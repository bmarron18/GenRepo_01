	abstract = {Summary
The hydrologic uncertainty of climate change impacts in two river basins in the Pacific Northwest of US is investigated. One basin is dominated by snowfall in winter, resulting in snowmelt in spring and early summer, and the other basin is dominated by rainfall in all seasons. In addition to hydrologic uncertainties, we consider the combined effect of two emission scenarios and eight general circulation models (GCMs) in our analyses. Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) is employed to sample the Precipitation Runoff Modeling System (PRMS) parameter space and the behavioral parameter sets were obtained according to a statistical performance measure. The results suggest that the relative impacts of uncertainties from different sources vary between the two basins. It is shown that changes in winter runoff are more affected by hydrologic model parameter uncertainty in the snow-dominated basin, while they are less influenced in the rain-dominated basin. The differences in the amount and timing of snowmelt as a result of model parameter uncertainty contribute to the variations of change in winter runoff in the snowfall-dominated basin. This result indicates that climate change impact studies for snow-dominated regions require more cautious interpretation of runoff projections due to considerable uncertainty in estimated hydrologic model parameters.},

	shorttitle = {Teaming with microbes},
	abstract = {This book provides information on ways to strengthen and cultivate the soil food web to grow healthy plants without the use of chemicals. Smart gardeners know that soil is anything but an inert substance. Healthy soil is teeming with life, not just earthworms and insects, but a staggering multitude of bacteria, fungi, and other microorganisms. When we use chemical fertilizers, we injure the microbial life that sustains healthy plants and become increasingly dependent on an arsenal of artificial, often toxic, substances. But there is an alternative to this vicious cycle. We can garden in a way that strengthens the soil food web, the complex world of soil-dwelling organisms whose interactions create a nurturing environment for plants. The book extols the benefits of cultivating the soil food web. First, it clearly explains the activities and organisms that make up the web. Next, it explains how gardeners can cultivate the life of the soil through the use of compost, mulches, and compost tea. The revised edition updates the original text and includes two completely new chapters on mycorrhizae (beneficial associations fungi form with green-leaved plants) and archaea (single-celled organisms once thought to be allied to bacteria). With the author's help, everyone, from devotees of organic gardening techniques to weekend gardeners who simply want to grow healthy, vigorous plants without resorting to chemicals, can create rich, nurturing, living soil.},

A variety of data sets are used to construct global N budgets for 1860 and the early 1990s and to make projections for the global N budget in 2050. Regional N budgets for Asia, North America, and other major regions for the early 1990s, as well as the marine N budget, are presented to Highlight the dominant fluxes of nitrogen in each region. Important findings are that human activities increasingly dominate the N budget at the global and at most regional scales, the terrestrial and open ocean N budgets are essentially disconnected, and the fixed forms of N are accumulating in most environmental reservoirs. The largest uncertainties in our understanding of the N budget at most scales are the rates of natural biological nitrogen fixation, the amount of Nr storage in most environmental reservoirs, and the production rates of N2 by denitrification.},

Toxicol. Pharmacol.7, 135–148). The present review presents an updated overview and evaluation of the available information on the same health effects of nitrate and nitrite with an emphasis on data not included in the previous review, which should be used as a compendium to this report. Recent epidemiologic data have suggested an association between developmental effects in offspring and the maternal ingestion of nitrate from drinking water, but a definite conclusion on the cause and effect relationship cannot be drawn. Animal experimental data have shown reproductive toxicity associated with high exposure levels to nitrate or nitrite, which are not likely to be encountered in drinking water. No teratogenic effects were observed in rats, mice, rabbits, and hamsters tested. Several cases of methemoglobinemia have been reported in infants in the United States using water containing nitrate at levels higher than the current maximum contaminant level (MCL) of 45 ppm (mg/liter) nitrate (NO3) or 10 ppm nitrate–nitrogen (nitrate–N), but none at or lower than the MCL. The uncertainties in the data base are discussed, noting that no uncertainty factor was applied in deriving the MCL in order to account for the uncertainties that exist in the data base.},

	abstract = {This paper aims to provide guidance to ecologists with limited experience in spatial analysis to help in their choice of techniques. It uses examples to compare methods of spatial analysis for ecological field data. A taxonomy of different data types is presented, including point- and area-referenced data, with and without attributes. Spatially and non-spatially explicit data are distinguished. The effects of sampling and other transformations that convert one data type to another are discussed; the possible loss of spatial information is considered.  Techniques for analyzing spatial pattern, developed in plant ecology, animal ecology, landscape ecology, geostatistics and applied statistics are reviewed briefly and their overlap in methodology and philosophy noted. The techniques are categorized according to their output and the inferences that may be drawn from them, in a discursive style without formulae. Methods are compared for four case studies with field data covering a range of types. These are: 1) percentage cover of three shrubs along a line transect; 2) locations and volume of a desert plant in a 1 ha area; 3) a remotely-sensed spectral index and elevation from 105 km2 of a mountainous region; and 4) land cover from three rangeland types within 800 km2 of a coastal region. Initial approaches utilize mapping, frequency distributions and variance-mean indices. Analysis techniques we compare include: local quadrat variance, block quadrat variance, correlograms, variograms, angular correlation, directional variograms, wavelets, SADIE, nearest neighbour methods, Ripley's (t), and various landscape ecology metrics.  Our advice to ecologists is to use simple visualization techniques for initial analysis, and subsequently to select methods that are appropriate for the data type and that answer their specific questions of interest. It is usually prudent to employ several different techniques.},

	abstract = {"Preface. History. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, in which plausible values for unknown quantities are simulated from their appropriate probability distribution, have revolutionised the practice of statistics. For more than 20 years the BUGS project has been at the forefront of this movement. The BUGS project began in Cambridge, in 1989, just as Alan Gelfand and Adrian Smith were working 80 miles away in Nottingham on their classic Gibbs sampler paper (Gelfand and Smith, 1990) that kicked off the revolution. But we never communicated (except through the intermediate node of David Clayton) and whereas the Gelfand-Smith approach used image-processing as inspiration, the philosophy behind BUGS was rooted more in techniques for handling uncertainty in artificial intelligence using directed graphical models and what came to be called Bayesian networks (Pearl, 1988). Lunn et al. (2009b) lay out all this history in greater detail. Some people have accused Markov chain Monte Carlo methods of being slow, but nothing could compare with the time it has taken this book to be written! The first proposal dates from 1995, but things got in the way, as they do, and it needed a vigorous new generation of researchers to finally get it finished. It is slightly galling that much of the current book could have been written in the mid-1990s, since the basic ideas of the software, the language for model description, and indeed some of the examples are unchanged. Nevertheless there have been important developments in the extended gestational period of the book, for example techniques for model criticism and comparison, implementation of differential equations and nonparametric techniques, and the ability to run BUGS code within a range of alternative programs"–},

	shorttitle = {Seeing like a state},
	abstract = {In this wide-ranging and original book, James C. Scott analyzes failed cases of large-scale authoritarian plans in a variety of fields. He argues that centrally managed social plans derail when they impose schematic visions that do violence to complex interdependencies that are not - and cannot be - fully understood. Further the success of designs for social organization depends on the recognition that local, practical knowledge is as important as formal, epistemic knowledge. The author builds a persuasive case against "development theory" and imperialistic state planning that disregards the values, desires, and objections of its subjects. And in discussing these planning disasters, he identifies four conditions common to them all: the state's attempt to impose administrative order on nature and society; a high-modernist ideology that believes scientific intervention can improve every aspect of human life; a willingness to use authoritarian state power to effect large-scale innovations; and a prostrate civil society that cannot effectively resist such plans.},

The report also identifies the challenges inherent in aligning the components of K-12 science education with this new vision for science and engineering education, provides recommendations for standards development, and lays out a research agenda that would generate the insights needed to update the framework and generate new standards in the future. The committee emphasizes that greater improvements in K-12 science and engineering education will be made when all components of the system–from standards and assessments, to support for new and established teachers, to providing sufficient time for learning science–are aligned with the framework's vision"–Executive summary.},

	abstract = {Although it is well established that soils are the dominating source for atmospheric nitrous oxide (N2O), we are still struggling to fully understand the complexity of the underlying microbial production and consumption processes and the links to biotic (e.g. inter- and intraspecies competition, food webs, plant–microbe interaction) and abiotic (e.g. soil climate, physics and chemistry) factors. Recent work shows that a better understanding of the composition and diversity of the microbial community across a variety of soils in different climates and under different land use, as well as plant–microbe interactions in the rhizosphere, may provide a key to better understand the variability of N2O fluxes at the soil–atmosphere interface. Moreover, recent insights into the regulation of the reduction of N2O to dinitrogen (N2) have increased our understanding of N2O exchange. This improved process understanding, building on the increased use of isotope tracing techniques and metagenomics, needs to go along with improvements in measurement techniques for N2O (and N2) emission in order to obtain robust field and laboratory datasets for different ecosystem types. Advances in both fields are currently used to improve process descriptions in biogeochemical models, which may eventually be used not only to test our current process understanding from the microsite to the field level, but also used as tools for up-scaling emissions to landscapes and regions and to explore feedbacks of soil N2O emissions to changes in environmental conditions, land management and land use.},

A temporal partition (time-delay coarse graining of the phase space based on the symbol sequence statistics) is introduced with little if any intervention required for the targeting of the trajectory. Message transmission is performed by means of codeword, i.e., specific targeting instructions are sent to the receiver rather than the explicit message. This approach yields (i) error correction availability for transmission in the presence of noise or dropouts, (ii) transmission in a compressed format, (iii) a high level of security against undesirable detection, and (iv) language recognition.},

	abstract = {The management of landscapes for biological conservation and ecologically sustainable natural resource use are crucial global issues. Research for over two decades has resulted in a large literature, yet there is little consensus on the applicability or even the existence of general principles or broad considerations that could guide landscape conservation. We assess six major themes in the ecology and conservation of landscapes. We identify 13 important issues that need to be considered in developing approaches to landscape conservation. They include recognizing the importance of landscape mosaics (including the integration of terrestrial and aquatic areas), recognizing interactions between vegetation cover and vegetation configuration, using an appropriate landscape conceptual model, maintaining the capacity to recover from disturbance and managing landscapes in an adaptive framework. These considerations are influenced by landscape context, species assemblages and management goals and do not translate directly into on-the-ground management guidelines but they should be recognized by researchers and resource managers when developing guidelines for specific cases. Two crucial overarching issues are: (i) a clearly articulated vision for landscape conservation and (ii) quantifiable objectives that offer unambiguous signposts for measuring progress.},

The use of simulation in drug development is relatively new, but its use is increasing in relation to the speed at which modern computers run. One well known example of simulation in drug development is molecular modelling. Another use of simulation that is being seen recently in drug development is Monte Carlo simulation of clinical trials. Monte Carlo simulation differs from traditional simulation in that the model parameters are treated as stochastic or random variables, rather than as fixed values. The purpose of this paper is to provide a brief introduction to Monte Carlo simulation methods.},

For each method, we discuss whether the method is expected to be useful for high—dimensional problems such as arise in inference with graphical models. After the methods have been described, the terminology of Markov chain Monte Carlo methods is presented. The chapter concludes with a discussion of advanced methods, including methods for reducing random walk behaviour. For details of Monte Carlo methods, theorems and proofs and a full list of references, the reader is directed to Neal (1993), Gilks, Richardson and Spiegelhalter (1996), and Tanner (1996).},

Over the past century, however, the development of new agricultural practices to satisfy a growing global demand for food has drastically disrupted the nitrogen cycle. This has led to extensive eutrophication of fresh waters and coastal zones as well as increased inventories of the potent greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O). Microbial processes will ultimately restore balance to the nitrogen cycle, but the damage done by humans to the nitrogen economy of the planet will persist for decades, possibly centuries, if active intervention and careful management strategies are not initiated.},

It involves, first, fitting univariate models to each of the series, and then cross-correlating the two residual series thereby obtained. The asymptotic distribution of such a set of lagged residual cross-correlations is established to be of a very simple form under the null hypothesis of the two series' independence. A Monte Carlo study verifies the applicability of this distribution for series of length N = 50, 100, and 200. An attendant chi-square test statistic is discussed.},
