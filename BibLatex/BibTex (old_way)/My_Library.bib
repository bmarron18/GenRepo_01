Recent analytical and experimental advances have demonstrated that molecular structure alone does not control SOM stability: in fact, environmental and biological controls predominate.

	abstract = {Abstract: Qualitative analysis of stability in model ecosystems has previously been limited to determining whether a community matrix is sign stable or not with little analytical means to assess the impact of complexity on system stability. Systems are seen as either unconditionally or conditionally stable with little distinction and therefore much ambiguity in the likelihood of stability. First, we reexamine Hurwitz’s principal theorem for stability and propose two “Hurwitz criteria” that address different aspects of instability: positive feedback and insufficient lower‐level feedback. Second, we derive two qualitative metrics based on these criteria: weighted feedback (wFn) and weighted determinants (wΔn). Third, we test the utility of these qualitative metrics through quantitative simulations in a random and evenly distributed parameter space in models of various sizes and complexities. Taken together they provide a practical means to assess the relative degree to which ambiguity has entered into calculations of stability as a result of system structure and complexity. From these metrics we identify two classes of models that may have significant relevance to system research and management. This work helps to resolve some of the impasse between theoretical and empirical discussions on the complexity and stability of natural communities.},

	abstract = {This paper provides a review of recent developments on assessing the effect of agricultural systems on long-term productivity of soils. Cultivation of soils, besides affecting soil chemistry and structure, reduces biological activity due to the reduction of macroaggregates which provides an important microhabitat for microbial activity. Indirect evidence suggests that soil amendments such as animal and green manures, and plant diversity (crop rotations) may be more important in maintaining soil microbial activity/diversity than conservation tillage in monocultural systems. There is increasing evidence that crop rotation promotes crop productivity by suppressing deleterious microorganisms that flourish under monoculture. Additions of inorganic fertilizers can increase soil biological activity because of an increased plant biomass production which upon incorporation stimulates soil biological activity. Conversely, limited evidence suggests that repeated applications of inorganic fertilizer nutrients can suppress production of certain soil enzymes that are involved in cycling of a given nutrient. The observed transitory decrease in crop productivity during conversion from chemical intensive input to alternative systems (greater reliance on biological resources) may be due to the initial diminished biological potentials of conventionally managed soils to efficiently cycle and mineralize organic nutrient sources. This review reaffirms the continuing need for the maintenance of existing long-term experimental sites and establishment of new studies in major agroecosystems throughout the world.},

	abstract = {The Clackamas River is an approximately 83-mile (134 km) tributary of the Willamette River in northwestern Oregon, in the United States. Draining an area of about 940 square miles (2,435 km2), the Clackamas flows through mostly forested and rugged mountainous terrain in its upper reaches, and passes agricultural and urban areas in its lower third. The river rises in eastern Marion County, about 55 miles (89 km) east-southeast of Salem. The headwaters are on the slopes of Olallie Butte in the Mount Hood National Forest, about 10 miles (16 km) north of Mount Jefferson, at an elevation of 4,909 feet (1,496 m) in the Cascade Range. The Clackamas flows briefly north and then flows northwest through the mountains, passing through North Fork Reservoir and Estacada. It then emerges from the mountains southeast of Portland. It joins the Willamette near Oregon City and forms the boundary between Oregon City and Gladstone.
The Clackamas provides hydroelectric power and drinking water for some of the Portland metropolitan area, and it supports runs of Coho salmon, spring and fall Chinook salmon, and summer and winter steelhead. The river's old-growth forests, its habitat for several species of birds, its healthy fish runs, and the recreational opportunities that it provides—such as fishing and whitewater rafting—led to the designation of more than half of the length of the river into the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System (NWSRS). This environment also allowed Native Americans to settle in the river's basin as early as 10,000 years ago.
Regulation of the river began in 1905 with the Cazadero Dam. In 1912, the River Mill Dam intercepted wood and coarse sediment. Later dams at North Fork, Oak Grove, Stone Creek, and Timothy Lake also intercepted wood sediment on the lower river.},

	abstract = {Summary
The hydrologic uncertainty of climate change impacts in two river basins in the Pacific Northwest of US is investigated. One basin is dominated by snowfall in winter, resulting in snowmelt in spring and early summer, and the other basin is dominated by rainfall in all seasons. In addition to hydrologic uncertainties, we consider the combined effect of two emission scenarios and eight general circulation models (GCMs) in our analyses. Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) is employed to sample the Precipitation Runoff Modeling System (PRMS) parameter space and the behavioral parameter sets were obtained according to a statistical performance measure. The results suggest that the relative impacts of uncertainties from different sources vary between the two basins. It is shown that changes in winter runoff are more affected by hydrologic model parameter uncertainty in the snow-dominated basin, while they are less influenced in the rain-dominated basin. The differences in the amount and timing of snowmelt as a result of model parameter uncertainty contribute to the variations of change in winter runoff in the snowfall-dominated basin. This result indicates that climate change impact studies for snow-dominated regions require more cautious interpretation of runoff projections due to considerable uncertainty in estimated hydrologic model parameters.},

	abstract = {The diversity of life is ultimately generated by evolution, and much attention has focused on the rapid evolution of ecological traits. Yet, the tendency for many ecological traits to instead remain similar over time [niche conservatism (NC)] has many consequences for the fundamental patterns and processes studied in ecology and conservation biology. Here, we describe the mounting evidence for the importance of NC to major topics in ecology (e.g. species richness, ecosystem function) and conservation (e.g. climate change, invasive species). We also review other areas where it may be important but has generally been overlooked, in both ecology (e.g. food webs, disease ecology, mutualistic interactions) and conservation (e.g. habitat modification). We summarize methods for testing for NC, and suggest that a commonly used and advocated method (involving a test for phylogenetic signal) is potentially problematic, and describe alternative approaches. We suggest that considering NC: (1) focuses attention on the within-species processes that cause traits to be conserved over time, (2) emphasizes connections between questions and research areas that are not obviously related (e.g. invasives, global warming, tropical richness), and (3) suggests new areas for research (e.g. why are some clades largely nocturnal? why do related species share diseases?).},

Epigenetic reprogramming has important roles in imprinting, the natural as well as experimental acquisition of totipotency and pluripotency, control of transposons, and epigenetic inheritance across generations. Small RNAs and the inheritance of histone marks may also contribute to epigenetic inheritance and reprogramming.

This is regrettable because to secure relevant and accurate predictions it is always desirable to compare predictions derived from different kinds of models applied independently to the same set of species and using the same raw data. Here we compare predictions of range shifts under climate change scenarios for 2100 derived from niche-based models with those of a process-based model for 15 North American boreal and temperate tree species. A general pattern emerged from our comparisons: niche-based models tend to predict a stronger level of extinction and a greater proportion of colonization than the process-based model. This result likely arises because niche-based models do not take phenotypic plasticity and local adaptation into account. Nevertheless, as the two kinds of models rely on different assumptions, their complementarity is revealed by common findings. Both modeling approaches highlight a major potential limitation on species tracking their climatic niche because of migration constraints and identify similar zones where species extirpation is likely. Such convergent predictions from models built on very different principles provide a useful way to offset uncertainties at the continental scale. This study shows that the use in concert of both approaches with their own caveats and advantages is crucial to obtain more robust results and that comparisons among models are needed in the near future to gain accuracy regarding predictions of range shifts under climate change.},

	abstract = {Disrupting ecosystem components, while transferring and reconstructing them for experiments can produce myriad responses. Establishing the extent of these biological responses as the system approaches a new equilibrium allows us more reliably to emulate comparable native systems. That is, the sensitivity of analyzing ecosystem processes in a reconstructed system is improved by excluding the period when observed phenomena are primarily responses caused by establishing the experiment rather than effects of imposed treatments; achieved by determining the extent of any pulse of activity caused by preparatory procedures. A native forest soil was physically disrupted when it was collected, sieved, and then rebuilt in lysimeters in a controlled-environment study evaluating the influence of elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration and elevated atmospheric temperature on the reconstructed soil that was planted with Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii Mirb. Franco) seedlings. Generally, soil food web populations responded in two phases during the exposure as indicated by preliminary evaluation of the 4.5-year dataset. Also, previous work indicated that relatively elevated soil CO2 effluxes occurred during the first phase, suggesting that food web populations may have responded to carbon sources made available when the soil was harvested and its profile reconstructed in the lysimeters. Results are presented for bacterial and fungal biomass, numbers of protozoa and nematodes to gain insight on whether the first phase responses are attributable to the acute stress of physically disrupting the soil. We found clear relationships between changes in predator and prey populations. A prominent spike for many of the food web populations occurred the year after the climate exposures began. Except for total bacterial biomass and total fungal-hyphae biomass, overall food web responses generally were unrelated to treatments. It appears that initial food web population responses were related to increased availability of soil carbon caused by establishing the experiment. Our results provide insights into determining the length of time to maintain reconstructed forest ecosystems before responses are observed related to experimental treatments. It appears that as long as 3 years elapsed before the soil food web appeared to recover from the acute physical disturbance; 1 year of recovery prior to commencing the climate exposures to allow the soil to rest after it was reconstructed, plus approximately the first 2 years of maintaining the climate treatments. Accounting for consequences of such periods of adjustment is critical for forecasting whether comparable natural ecosystems will be net sources or sinks of elevated concentrations of atmospheric CO2.},

	abstract = {Summary
Soil communities in landscapes that are rapidly changing due to a range of anthropogenic processes can be regarded as highly transient systems where interactions between competing species or trophic levels may be seriously disrupted. In disturbed communities dispersal in space and time has a role in ensuring continuity of community function. Stable communities, in undisturbed systems, are more dependent on competition and other biotic interactions between species. We predicted how food web components would respond to disturbance, based on their dispersal and colonizing abilities. During decomposition, flows of energy and nutrients generally follow either a bacterial-based path, with bacteria as the primary decomposer and bacterial-feeding fauna and their predators forming the associated food web, or a fungal-based channel. Trophic links that were generally resistant to change were the organisms of the bacterial pathway that have high abilities to disperse in time and passively disperse in space. Organisms in the fungal pathway were less resistant to disturbance. Resource inputs to the soil system are derived from plants, either through root exudation and root turnover during active growth or from dead plant material following senescence or agricultural tillage. Disturbances to the soil system can arise as a direct action on the soil, or indirectly from effects on the above-ground plant community. Disturbance-induced changes in plant community composition will change the soil food web composition. Organisms involved in direct interactions with plants (e.g. AM-mycorrhizal fungi) were also predicted to be vulnerable to disturbance.},

Contaminated aquifers that discharge to streams can result in long-term contamination of surface water; conversely, streams can be a major source of contamination to aquifers. Surface water commonly is hydraulically connected to ground water, but the interactions are difficult to observe and measure.

Here we report results from a 21-year study of agronomic and ecological performance of biodynamic, bioorganic, and conventional farming systems in Central Europe. We found crop yields to be 20\% lower in the organic systems, although input of fertilizer and energy was reduced by 34 to 53\% and pesticide input by 97\%. Enhanced soil fertility and higher biodiversity found in organic plots may render these systems less dependent on external inputs.},

A researcher might develop a new method for the general task of classification, then assess its utility by comparing its performance (such as accuracy or AUC) to that of existing classification models on publicly available datasets. In terms of advancing machine learning as an academic discipline, this approach has thus far proven quite fruitful. However, it is our view that the most interesting open problems in machine learning are those that arise during its application to real-world problems. We illustrate this point by reviewing two of our interdisciplinary collaborations, both of which have posed unique machine learning problems, providing fertile ground for novel research.},

The use of simulation in drug development is relatively new, but its use is increasing in relation to the speed at which modern computers run. One well known example of simulation in drug development is molecular modelling. Another use of simulation that is being seen recently in drug development is Monte Carlo simulation of clinical trials. Monte Carlo simulation differs from traditional simulation in that the model parameters are treated as stochastic or random variables, rather than as fixed values. The purpose of this paper is to provide a brief introduction to Monte Carlo simulation methods.},

	abstract = {The major source of substrates for microbial activity in the ectorhizosphere and on the rhizoplane are rhizodeposition products. They are composed of exudates, lysates, mucilage, secretions and dead cell material, as well as gases including respiratory CO2. Depending on plant species, age and environmental conditions, these can account for up to 40\% (or more) of the dry matter produced by plants. The microbial populations colonizing the endorhizosphere, including mycorrhizae, pathogens and symbiotic N2-fixers have greater access to the total pool of carbon including that recently derived from photosynthesis. Utilization of rhizodeposition products induces at least a transient increase in soil biomass but a sustained increase depends on the state of the native soil biomass, the flow of other metabolites from the soil to the rhizosphere and the water relations of the soil. In addition, the phenomena of oligotrophy, cryptic growth, plasmolysis, dormancy and arrested metabolism can all influence the longevity of rhizosphere organisms. With this background, microbial growth in the rhizosphere will be discussed.},

	abstract = {This book provides information on ways to strengthen and cultivate the soil food web to grow healthy plants without the use of chemicals. Smart gardeners know that soil is anything but an inert substance. Healthy soil is teeming with life, not just earthworms and insects, but a staggering multitude of bacteria, fungi, and other microorganisms. When we use chemical fertilizers, we injure the microbial life that sustains healthy plants and become increasingly dependent on an arsenal of artificial, often toxic, substances. But there is an alternative to this vicious cycle. We can garden in a way that strengthens the soil food web, the complex world of soil-dwelling organisms whose interactions create a nurturing environment for plants. The book extols the benefits of cultivating the soil food web. First, it clearly explains the activities and organisms that make up the web. Next, it explains how gardeners can cultivate the life of the soil through the use of compost, mulches, and compost tea. The revised edition updates the original text and includes two completely new chapters on mycorrhizae (beneficial associations fungi form with green-leaved plants) and archaea (single-celled organisms once thought to be allied to bacteria). With the author's help, everyone, from devotees of organic gardening techniques to weekend gardeners who simply want to grow healthy, vigorous plants without resorting to chemicals, can create rich, nurturing, living soil.},

	abstract = {Abstract:  Assessment of long-term impacts of projected changes in climate, population, and land use and land cover on regional water resource is critical to the sustainable development of the southeastern United States. The objective of this study was to fully budget annual water availability for water supply (precipitation − evapotranspiration + groundwater supply + return flow) and demand from commercial, domestic, industrial, irrigation, livestock, mining, and thermoelectric uses. The Water Supply Stress Index and Water Supply Stress Index Ratio were developed to evaluate water stress conditions over time and across the 666 eight-digit Hydrologic Unit Code basins in the 13 southeastern states. Predictions from two Global Circulation Models (CGC1 and HadCM2Sul), one land use change model, and one human population model, were integrated to project future water supply stress in 2020. We found that population increase greatly stressed water supply in metropolitan areas located in the Piedmont region and Florida. Predicted land use and land cover changes will have little effect on water quantity and water supply-water demand relationship. In contrast, climate changes had the most pronounced effects on regional water supply and demand, especially in western Texas where water stress was historically highest in the study region. The simulation system developed by this study is useful for water resource planners to address water shortage problems such as those experienced during 2007 in the study region. Future studies should focus on refining the water supply term to include flow exchanges between watersheds and constraints of water quality and environmental flows to water availability for human use.},

Toxicol. Pharmacol.7, 135–148). The present review presents an updated overview and evaluation of the available information on the same health effects of nitrate and nitrite with an emphasis on data not included in the previous review, which should be used as a compendium to this report. Recent epidemiologic data have suggested an association between developmental effects in offspring and the maternal ingestion of nitrate from drinking water, but a definite conclusion on the cause and effect relationship cannot be drawn. Animal experimental data have shown reproductive toxicity associated with high exposure levels to nitrate or nitrite, which are not likely to be encountered in drinking water. No teratogenic effects were observed in rats, mice, rabbits, and hamsters tested. Several cases of methemoglobinemia have been reported in infants in the United States using water containing nitrate at levels higher than the current maximum contaminant level (MCL) of 45 ppm (mg/liter) nitrate (NO3) or 10 ppm nitrate–nitrogen (nitrate–N), but none at or lower than the MCL. The uncertainties in the data base are discussed, noting that no uncertainty factor was applied in deriving the MCL in order to account for the uncertainties that exist in the data base.},

If groundwater abstraction exceeds the natural groundwater recharge for extensive areas and long times, overexploitation or persistent groundwater depletion occurs. Here we provide a global overview of groundwater depletion (here defined as abstraction in excess of recharge) by assessing groundwater recharge with a global hydrological model and subtracting estimates of groundwater abstraction. Restricting our analysis to sub-humid to arid areas we estimate the total global groundwater depletion to have increased from 126 (±32) km3 a−1 in 1960 to 283 (±40) km3 a−1 in 2000. The latter equals 39 (±10)\% of the global yearly groundwater abstraction, 2 (±0.6)\% of the global yearly groundwater recharge, 0.8 (±0.1)\% of the global yearly continental runoff and 0.4 (±0.06)\% of the global yearly evaporation, contributing a considerable amount of 0.8 (±0.1) mm a−1 to current sea-level rise.},

	abstract = {Disturbance regimes are changing rapidly, and the consequences of such changes for ecosystems and linked social-ecological systems will be profound. This paper synthesizes current understanding of disturbance with an emphasis on fundamental contributions to contemporary landscape and ecosystem ecology, then identifies future research priorities. Studies of disturbance led to insights about heterogeneity, scale, and thresholds in space and time and catalyzed new paradigms in ecology. Because they create vegetation patterns, disturbances also establish spatial patterns of many ecosystem processes on the landscape. Drivers of global change will produce new spatial patterns, altered disturbance regimes, novel trajectories of change, and surprises. Future disturbances will continue to provide valuable opportunities for studying pattern–process interactions. Changing disturbance regimes will produce acute changes in ecosystems and ecosystem services over the short (years to decades) and long term (centuries and beyond). Future research should address questions related to (1) disturbances as catalysts of rapid ecological change, (2) interactions among disturbances, (3) relationships between disturbance and society, especially the intersection of land use and disturbance, and (4) feedbacks from disturbance to other global drivers. Ecologists should make a renewed and concerted effort to understand and anticipate the causes and consequences of changing disturbance regimes.

A variety of data sets are used to construct global N budgets for 1860 and the early 1990s and to make projections for the global N budget in 2050. Regional N budgets for Asia, North America, and other major regions for the early 1990s, as well as the marine N budget, are presented to Highlight the dominant fluxes of nitrogen in each region. Important findings are that human activities increasingly dominate the N budget at the global and at most regional scales, the terrestrial and open ocean N budgets are essentially disconnected, and the fixed forms of N are accumulating in most environmental reservoirs. The largest uncertainties in our understanding of the N budget at most scales are the rates of natural biological nitrogen fixation, the amount of Nr storage in most environmental reservoirs, and the production rates of N2 by denitrification.},

	abstract = {Although it is well established that soils are the dominating source for atmospheric nitrous oxide (N2O), we are still struggling to fully understand the complexity of the underlying microbial production and consumption processes and the links to biotic (e.g. inter- and intraspecies competition, food webs, plant–microbe interaction) and abiotic (e.g. soil climate, physics and chemistry) factors. Recent work shows that a better understanding of the composition and diversity of the microbial community across a variety of soils in different climates and under different land use, as well as plant–microbe interactions in the rhizosphere, may provide a key to better understand the variability of N2O fluxes at the soil–atmosphere interface. Moreover, recent insights into the regulation of the reduction of N2O to dinitrogen (N2) have increased our understanding of N2O exchange. This improved process understanding, building on the increased use of isotope tracing techniques and metagenomics, needs to go along with improvements in measurement techniques for N2O (and N2) emission in order to obtain robust field and laboratory datasets for different ecosystem types. Advances in both fields are currently used to improve process descriptions in biogeochemical models, which may eventually be used not only to test our current process understanding from the microsite to the field level, but also used as tools for up-scaling emissions to landscapes and regions and to explore feedbacks of soil N2O emissions to changes in environmental conditions, land management and land use.},

Toxicol. Pharmacol.7, 135–148). The present review presents an updated overview and evaluation of the available information on the same health effects of nitrate and nitrite with an emphasis on data not included in the previous review, which should be used as a compendium to this report. Recent epidemiologic data have suggested an association between developmental effects in offspring and the maternal ingestion of nitrate from drinking water, but a definite conclusion on the cause and effect relationship cannot be drawn. Animal experimental data have shown reproductive toxicity associated with high exposure levels to nitrate or nitrite, which are not likely to be encountered in drinking water. No teratogenic effects were observed in rats, mice, rabbits, and hamsters tested. Several cases of methemoglobinemia have been reported in infants in the United States using water containing nitrate at levels higher than the current maximum contaminant level (MCL) of 45 ppm (mg/liter) nitrate (NO3) or 10 ppm nitrate–nitrogen (nitrate–N), but none at or lower than the MCL. The uncertainties in the data base are discussed, noting that no uncertainty factor was applied in deriving the MCL in order to account for the uncertainties that exist in the data base.},

Much anthropogenic nitrogen is lost to air, water, and land to cause a cascade of environmental and human health problems. Simultaneously, food production in some parts of the world is nitrogen-deficient, highlighting inequities in the distribution of nitrogen-containing fertilizers. Optimizing the need for a key human resource while minimizing its negative consequences requires an integrated interdisciplinary approach and the development of strategies to decrease nitrogen-containing waste.},

	abstract = {This paper aims to provide guidance to ecologists with limited experience in spatial analysis to help in their choice of techniques. It uses examples to compare methods of spatial analysis for ecological field data. A taxonomy of different data types is presented, including point- and area-referenced data, with and without attributes. Spatially and non-spatially explicit data are distinguished. The effects of sampling and other transformations that convert one data type to another are discussed; the possible loss of spatial information is considered.  Techniques for analyzing spatial pattern, developed in plant ecology, animal ecology, landscape ecology, geostatistics and applied statistics are reviewed briefly and their overlap in methodology and philosophy noted. The techniques are categorized according to their output and the inferences that may be drawn from them, in a discursive style without formulae. Methods are compared for four case studies with field data covering a range of types. These are: 1) percentage cover of three shrubs along a line transect; 2) locations and volume of a desert plant in a 1 ha area; 3) a remotely-sensed spectral index and elevation from 105 km2 of a mountainous region; and 4) land cover from three rangeland types within 800 km2 of a coastal region. Initial approaches utilize mapping, frequency distributions and variance-mean indices. Analysis techniques we compare include: local quadrat variance, block quadrat variance, correlograms, variograms, angular correlation, directional variograms, wavelets, SADIE, nearest neighbour methods, Ripley's (t), and various landscape ecology metrics.  Our advice to ecologists is to use simple visualization techniques for initial analysis, and subsequently to select methods that are appropriate for the data type and that answer their specific questions of interest. It is usually prudent to employ several different techniques.},

	abstract = {The re-establishment of natural species rich heathlands on abandoned agricultural land is a common land use change in North-West Europe. However, it can take several decades to re-establish natural species rich heathland vegetation. The development rate has found to depend both on soil food web composition and on soil processes.

We measured the soil food web composition in three ex-arable fields abandoned 2, 9 and 22 years ago and in a heathland. To characterize food structure, we defined four trophic levels and a root, fungal and bacterial energy channel. We hypothesized that with increasing time since abandonment, i.e. field age, (1) the basic resource level biomass, i.e. soil organic matter (SOM) and roots, will increase and thereby also that of biomasses at higher trophic levels, (2a) the root energy channel biomass will decrease, (2b) the fungal energy channel biomass will increase, and (2c) the bacterial energy channel biomass will not change.

The results showed that biomasses at the basic resource level and at the first trophic level indeed increased with field age, but not the biomasses at higher trophic levels. It is not clear what the cause of the lack of increase in higher trophic levels was, possibly top-down or bottom-up forces played a role.

The root energy channel biomass decreased and the fungal channel increased as hypothesized, but the bacterial channel biomass also increased with field age. The increase of the bacterial channel biomass contradicted the hypothesis, but agreed with the observed increase in SOM quantity and lack of decrease in SOM quality.

On overall, results show that changes in belowground food webs lag behind changes of the aboveground vegetation. Such time lags may hamper secondary vegetation succession. Understanding those time lags may therefore help to develop management schemes improving land conversion processes.},

	abstract = {Using the UNFCCC as a basis, and the objectives of estimating soil organic carbon (SOC) changes during the period 1900–2100, a spatially explicit database of climate, land cover and soil texture was compiled for a 262,000 km2 region in semi-arid Sudan. The area is characterized by low input cultivation of millet, sorghum and sesamé combined with livestock grazing. By integrating the database with the CENTURY ecosystem model, we were able to estimate historical, current and future pools of SOC as a function of land management and climate. The SOC (upper 20 cm) decrease from 1900 to 2000 was estimated to be 6·8 Mt and the maximum potential carbon sink (SOC increase) for the period 2000 to 2100 was estimated to be 17 Mt. Cropland and grassland lost 293 and 152 t SOC km−2 respectively whereas the savannahs gained 76 t SOC km−2 from 1900 to 2000. The SOC sequestration scenario simulated during 2000–2100 recovered 94, 84 and 75 t km−2 for cropland, grassland and savannah respectively. In addition to climate and soils, cropping intensity, fallow periods, fire frequency and grazing intensity also influence cropland SOC variation. Grassland and savannah SOC variations depend on grazing intensity and fire return interval. Land management may affect future amounts of SOC in semi-arid areas thereby turning them from sources into sinks of carbon. SOC estimates were reasonably consistent with measurements (r2=0·70, n=13).},

	abstract = {"Preface. History. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, in which plausible values for unknown quantities are simulated from their appropriate probability distribution, have revolutionised the practice of statistics. For more than 20 years the BUGS project has been at the forefront of this movement. The BUGS project began in Cambridge, in 1989, just as Alan Gelfand and Adrian Smith were working 80 miles away in Nottingham on their classic Gibbs sampler paper (Gelfand and Smith, 1990) that kicked off the revolution. But we never communicated (except through the intermediate node of David Clayton) and whereas the Gelfand-Smith approach used image-processing as inspiration, the philosophy behind BUGS was rooted more in techniques for handling uncertainty in artificial intelligence using directed graphical models and what came to be called Bayesian networks (Pearl, 1988). Lunn et al. (2009b) lay out all this history in greater detail. Some people have accused Markov chain Monte Carlo methods of being slow, but nothing could compare with the time it has taken this book to be written! The first proposal dates from 1995, but things got in the way, as they do, and it needed a vigorous new generation of researchers to finally get it finished. It is slightly galling that much of the current book could have been written in the mid-1990s, since the basic ideas of the software, the language for model description, and indeed some of the examples are unchanged. Nevertheless there have been important developments in the extended gestational period of the book, for example techniques for model criticism and comparison, implementation of differential equations and nonparametric techniques, and the ability to run BUGS code within a range of alternative programs"–},

Biologists now suggest that a sixth mass extinction may be under way, given the known species losses over the past few centuries and millennia. Here we review how differences between fossil and modern data and the addition of recently available palaeontological information influence our understanding of the current extinction crisis. Our results confirm that current extinction rates are higher than would be expected from the fossil record, highlighting the need for effective conservation measures.},

Our aim is to persuade members of both the biological and mathematical communities of the need to collaborate in developing quantitative mechanistic models. We believe that such models will lead to a more profound understanding of the fundamental science of plants and may help us with managing real-world problems such as food shortages and global warming. We start the paper by reviewing mathematical models that have been developed to describe nutrient and water uptake by a single root. We discuss briefly the mathematical techniques involved in analysing these models and present some of the analytical results of these models. Then, we describe how the information gained from the single-root scale models can be translated to root system and field scales. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of different mathematical approaches and make a case that mechanistic rather than phenomenological models will in the end be more trustworthy. We also discuss the need for a considerable amount of effort on the fundamental mathematics of upscaling and homogenization methods specialized for branched networks such as roots. Finally, we discuss different future avenues of research and how we believe these should be approached so that in the long term it will be possible to develop a valid, quantitative whole-plant model.},

	abstract = {The CENTURY model of soil organic matter turn-over developed by Parton and co-workers has been used successfully for grasslands to predict dynamics of C, N and other nutrients. It was tested here for decomposition of a range of forest litters and for N mineralisation in forest soils. Modifications to the CENTURY model were necessary to match model output to empirical findings. These modifications included: (1) incorporation of additional woody litter pools (i.e. fine-wood and coarse-wood) (2) allowing the N content of soil organic matter (SOM) pools to vary (3) constraining N mineralisation and immobilisation to the active SOM pool (4) incorporation of a small flux of mineral N to the resistant SOM pool (5) allowance of mycorrhizal uptake of N, and (6) re-formulation of temperature and moisture effects on decomposition. Other possible changes, such as giving greater flexibility to the critical N concentration for mineralisation, were tested but found not to improve model performance.

The modified model largely accounted for the effects of initial lignin and N concentration on subsequent litter decomposition rate, litter N concentrations and critical N concentrations for the commencement of mineralisation. Consequently, the model could successfully simulate realistic time courses of N immobilisation and subsequent mineralisation for a range of litter types. The present model also successfully predicted the critical N concentration for N mineralisation across a wide range of litter samples from forests and other vegetation sources. Net N mineralisation was successfully simulated in forest soils, which were either untreated, irrigated or fertilised.},

Using a natural 13C tracer method to separately measure SOM-derived CO2 from root-derived CO2, this study aims to connect the level of rhizosphere-dependent SOM decomposition with the C and N balance of the whole plant–soil system, and to mechanistically link the rhizosphere priming effect to soil microbial turnover and evapotranspiration. Results indicated that the magnitude of the rhizosphere priming effect on SOM decomposition varied widely, from zero to more than 380\% of the unplanted control, and was largely influenced by plant species and phenology. Balancing the extra soil C loss from the strong rhizosphere priming effect in the planted treatments with C inputs from rhizodeposits and root biomass, the whole plant–soil system remained with a net carbon gain at the end of the experiment. The increased soil microbial biomass turnover rate and the enhanced evapotranspiration rate in the planted treatments had clear positive relationships with the level of the rhizosphere priming effect. The rhizosphere enhancement of soil carbon mineralization in the planted treatments did not result in a proportional increase in net N mineralization, suggesting a possible de-coupling of C cycling with N cycling in the rhizosphere.},

	doi = {10.1890/08-0134.1},
	abstract = {Obtaining reliable predictions of species range shifts under climate change is a crucial challenge for ecologists and stakeholders. At the continental scale, niche-based models have been widely used in the last 10 years to predict the potential impacts of climate change on species distributions all over the world, although these models do not include any mechanistic relationships. In contrast, species-specific, process-based predictions remain scarce at the continental scale. This is regrettable because to secure relevant and accurate predictions it is always desirable to compare predictions derived from different kinds of models applied independently to the same set of species and using the same raw data. Here we compare predictions of range shifts under climate change scenarios for 2100 derived from niche-based models with those of a process-based model for 15 North American boreal and temperate tree species. A general pattern emerged from our comparisons: niche-based models tend to predict a stronger level of extinction and a greater proportion of colonization than the process-based model. This result likely arises because niche-based models do not take phenotypic plasticity and local adaptation into account. Nevertheless, as the two kinds of models rely on different assumptions, their complementarity is revealed by common findings. Both modeling approaches highlight a major potential limitation on species tracking their climatic niche because of migration constraints and identify similar zones where species extirpation is likely. Such convergent predictions from models built on very different principles provide a useful way to offset uncertainties at the continental scale. This study shows that the use in concert of both approaches with their own caveats and advantages is crucial to obtain more robust results and that comparisons among models are needed in the near future to gain accuracy regarding predictions of range shifts under climate change.},

He argues that centrally managed social plans derail when they impose schematic visions that do violence to complex interdependencies that are not - and cannot be - fully understood. Further the success of designs for social organization depends on the recognition that local, practical knowledge is as important as formal, epistemic knowledge. The author builds a persuasive case against "development theory" and imperialistic state planning that disregards the values, desires, and objections of its subjects. And in discussing these planning disasters, he identifies four conditions common to them all: the state's attempt to impose administrative order on nature and society; a high-modernist ideology that believes scientific intervention can improve every aspect of human life; a willingness to use authoritarian state power to effect large-scale innovations; and a prostrate civil society that cannot effectively resist such plans.},

	doi = {10.1038/nature11069},
	abstract = {Numerous reports have emphasized the need for major changes in the global food system: agriculture must meet the twin challenge of feeding a growing population, with rising demand for meat and high-calorie diets, while simultaneously minimizing its global environmental impacts. Organic farming—a system aimed at producing food with minimal harm to ecosystems, animals or humans—is often proposed as a solution. However, critics argue that organic agriculture may have lower yields and would therefore need more land to produce the same amount of food as conventional farms, resulting in more widespread deforestation and biodiversity loss, and thus undermining the environmental benefits of organic practices. Here we use a comprehensive meta-analysis to examine the relative yield performance of organic and conventional farming systems globally. Our analysis of available data shows that, overall, organic yields are typically lower than conventional yields. But these yield differences are highly contextual, depending on system and site characteristics, and range from 5\% lower organic yields (rain-fed legumes and perennials on weak-acidic to weak-alkaline soils), 13\% lower yields (when best organic practices are used), to 34\% lower yields (when the conventional and organic systems are most comparable). Under certain conditions—that is, with good management practices, particular crop types and growing conditions—organic systems can thus nearly match conventional yields, whereas under others it at present cannot. To establish organic agriculture as an important tool in sustainable food production, the factors limiting organic yields need to be more fully understood, alongside assessments of the many social, environmental and economic benefits of organic farming systems.},

We found that Century successfully simulates SOM C across a variety of land use and climate types. Simulations of SOM were most successful in grass and crop systems. This exercise highlights a structural limitation of Century in simulating SOM in a forest with a developed litter layer. Simulations of tree biomass distributions, however, were generally successful. The model failed to capture extreme values of yield and N offtake, although annual averages were quite similar between observations and simulations, leading to reasonable estimates of SOM C. Average yields and SOM were generally higher in amended treatments or rotations including an N-fixing component such as alfalfa. The model successfully predicted SOM dynamics across climates, land use types, and treatments. This suggests that Century is a useful tool for ecosystem studies, particularly those focused on SOM dynamics.},

Previous studies have shown that climate constraints were relaxing with increasing temperature and solar radiation, allowing an upward trend in NPP from 1982 through 1999. The past decade (2000 to 2009) has been the warmest since instrumental measurements began, which could imply continued increases in NPP; however, our estimates suggest a reduction in the global NPP of 0.55 petagrams of carbon. Large-scale droughts have reduced regional NPP, and a drying trend in the Southern Hemisphere has decreased NPP in that area, counteracting the increased NPP over the Northern Hemisphere. A continued decline in NPP would not only weaken the terrestrial carbon sink, but it would also intensify future competition between food demand and proposed biofuel production.},

	abstract = {Summary
The hydrologic uncertainty of climate change impacts in two river basins in the Pacific Northwest of US is investigated. One basin is dominated by snowfall in winter, resulting in snowmelt in spring and early summer, and the other basin is dominated by rainfall in all seasons. In addition to hydrologic uncertainties, we consider the combined effect of two emission scenarios and eight general circulation models (GCMs) in our analyses. Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) is employed to sample the Precipitation Runoff Modeling System (PRMS) parameter space and the behavioral parameter sets were obtained according to a statistical performance measure. The results suggest that the relative impacts of uncertainties from different sources vary between the two basins. It is shown that changes in winter runoff are more affected by hydrologic model parameter uncertainty in the snow-dominated basin, while they are less influenced in the rain-dominated basin. The differences in the amount and timing of snowmelt as a result of model parameter uncertainty contribute to the variations of change in winter runoff in the snowfall-dominated basin. This result indicates that climate change impact studies for snow-dominated regions require more cautious interpretation of runoff projections due to considerable uncertainty in estimated hydrologic model parameters.},

	title = {The {Problem} of {Induction}},
	url = {http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2016/entries/induction-problem/},
	abstract = {The original problem of induction can be simply put.  It concernsthe support or justification of inductive methods; methods thatpredict or infer, in Hume's words, that “instances of which wehave had no experience resemble those of which we have hadexperience” (THN, 89). Such methods are clearly essential inscientific reasoning as well as in the conduct of our everydayaffairs.  The problem is how to support or justify them and it leadsto a dilemma: the principle cannot be proved deductively, for it iscontingent, and only necessary truths can be proved deductively.  Norcan it be supported inductively—by arguing that it has always orusually been reliable in the past—for that would beg thequestion by assuming just what is to be proved.  , A century after Hume first put the problem, and argued that it isinsoluble, J. S. Mill gave a more specific formulation of an importantclass of inductive problems: “Why,” he wrote, “is asingle instance, in some cases, sufficient for a complete induction,while in others myriads of concurring instances, without a singleexception known or presumed, go such a little way towards establishingan universal proposition?” (Mill 1843, Bk III,Ch. III). (Compare: (i) Everyone seated on the bus is movingnorthward. (ii) Everyone seated on the bus was born on a primenumbered day of the month.), In recent times inductive methods have fissioned and multiplied, toan extent that attempting to define induction would be more difficultthan rewarding.  It is however instructive to contrast induction withdeduction: Deductive logic, at least as concerns first-order logic, isdemonstrably complete.  The premises of an argument constructedaccording to the rules of this logic imply the argument's conclusion.Not so for induction: There is no comprehensive theory of soundinduction, no set of agreed upon rules that license good or soundinductive inference, nor is there a serious prospect of such a theory.Further, induction differs from deductive proof or demonstration (infirst-order logic, at least) not only in induction's failure topreserve truth (true premises may lead inductively to falseconclusions) but also in failing of monotonicity: adding true premisesto a sound induction may make it unsound. , The characterization of good or sound inductions might be called thecharacterization problem: What distinguishes good from bad inductions?The question seems to have no rewarding general answer, but there arenevertheless interesting partial characterizations, some of which areexplored in this entry.},

In order to ensure balanced coverage, we also include brief consideration of the ways in which AM fungi may influence soil structure, carbon deposition in soil and interactions with the soil microbial and animal populations, as well as plant-plant competition. These interlinked outcomes of AM symbioses go well beyond effects in increasing nutrient uptake that are commonly discussed and all require to be taken into consideration in future work designed to understand the complex and multifaceted responses of plants to abiotic and biotic stresses in agricultural and natural environments.},

	abstract = {Nine soil organic models were evaluated using twelve datasets from seven long-term experiments. Datasets represented three different land-uses (grassland, arable cropping and woodland) and a range of climatic conditions within the temperate region. Different treatments (inorganic fertilizer, organic manures and different rotations) at the same site allowed the effects of differing land management to be explored. Model simulations were evaluated against the measured data and the performance of the models was compared both qualitatively and quantitatively. Not all models were able to simulate all datasets; only four attempted all. No one model performed better than all others across all datasets. The performance of each model in simulating each dataset is discussed. A comparison of the overall performance of models across all datasets reveals that the model errors of one group of models (RothC, CANDY, DNDC, CENTURY, DAISY and NCSOIL) did not differ significantly from each other. Another group (SOMM, ITE and Verberne) did not differ significantly from each other but showed significantly larger model errors than did models in the first group. Possible reasons for differences in model performance are discussed in detail.},

	abstract = {Although it is well established that soils are the dominating source for atmospheric nitrous oxide (N2O), we are still struggling to fully understand the complexity of the underlying microbial production and consumption processes and the links to biotic (e.g. inter- and intraspecies competition, food webs, plant–microbe interaction) and abiotic (e.g. soil climate, physics and chemistry) factors. Recent work shows that a better understanding of the composition and diversity of the microbial community across a variety of soils in different climates and under different land use, as well as plant–microbe interactions in the rhizosphere, may provide a key to better understand the variability of N2O fluxes at the soil–atmosphere interface. Moreover, recent insights into the regulation of the reduction of N2O to dinitrogen (N2) have increased our understanding of N2O exchange. This improved process understanding, building on the increased use of isotope tracing techniques and metagenomics, needs to go along with improvements in measurement techniques for N2O (and N2) emission in order to obtain robust field and laboratory datasets for different ecosystem types. Advances in both fields are currently used to improve process descriptions in biogeochemical models, which may eventually be used not only to test our current process understanding from the microsite to the field level, but also used as tools for up-scaling emissions to landscapes and regions and to explore feedbacks of soil N2O emissions to changes in environmental conditions, land management and land use.},

For each method, we discuss whether the method is expected to be useful for high—dimensional problems such as arise in inference with graphical models. After the methods have been described, the terminology of Markov chain Monte Carlo methods is presented. The chapter concludes with a discussion of advanced methods, including methods for reducing random walk behaviour. For details of Monte Carlo methods, theorems and proofs and a full list of references, the reader is directed to Neal (1993), Gilks, Richardson and Spiegelhalter (1996), and Tanner (1996).},

A temporal partition (time-delay coarse graining of the phase space based on the symbol sequence statistics) is introduced with little if any intervention required for the targeting of the trajectory. Message transmission is performed by means of codeword, i.e., specific targeting instructions are sent to the receiver rather than the explicit message. This approach yields (i) error correction availability for transmission in the presence of noise or dropouts, (ii) transmission in a compressed format, (iii) a high level of security against undesirable detection, and (iv) language recognition.},

Research for over two decades has resulted in a large literature, yet there is little consensus on the applicability or even the existence of general principles or broad considerations that could guide landscape conservation. We assess six major themes in the ecology and conservation of landscapes. We identify 13 important issues that need to be considered in developing approaches to landscape conservation. They include recognizing the importance of landscape mosaics (including the integration of terrestrial and aquatic areas), recognizing interactions between vegetation cover and vegetation configuration, using an appropriate landscape conceptual model, maintaining the capacity to recover from disturbance and managing landscapes in an adaptive framework. These considerations are influenced by landscape context, species assemblages and management goals and do not translate directly into on-the-ground management guidelines but they should be recognized by researchers and resource managers when developing guidelines for specific cases. Two crucial overarching issues are: (i) a clearly articulated vision for landscape conservation and (ii) quantifiable objectives that offer unambiguous signposts for measuring progress.},

The use of simulation in drug development is relatively new, but its use is increasing in relation to the speed at which modern computers run. One well known example of simulation in drug development is molecular modelling. Another use of simulation that is being seen recently in drug development is Monte Carlo simulation of clinical trials. Monte Carlo simulation differs from traditional simulation in that the model parameters are treated as stochastic or random variables, rather than as fixed values. The purpose of this paper is to provide a brief introduction to Monte Carlo simulation methods.},

	abstract = {* Plant–soil feedbacks is becoming an important concept for explaining vegetation dynamics, the invasiveness of introduced exotic species in new habitats and how terrestrial ecosystems respond to global land use and climate change. Using a new conceptual model, we show how critical alterations in plant–soil feedback interactions can change the assemblage of plant communities. We highlight recent advances, define terms and identify future challenges in this area of research and discuss how variations in strengths and directions of plant–soil feedbacks can explain succession, invasion, response to climate warming and diversity-productivity relationships.


* While there has been a rapid increase in understanding the biological, chemical and physical mechanisms and their interdependencies underlying plant–soil feedback interactions, further progress is to be expected from applying new experimental techniques and technologies, linking empirical studies to modelling and field-based studies that can include plant–soil feedback interactions on longer time scales that also include long-term processes such as litter decomposition and mineralization.


* Significant progress has also been made in analysing consequences of plant–soil feedbacks for biodiversity-functioning relationships, plant fitness and selection.


* To further integrate plant–soil feedbacks into ecological theory, it will be important to determine where and how observed patterns may be generalized, and how they may influence evolution.


* Synthesis. Gaining a greater understanding of plant–soil feedbacks and underlying mechanisms is improving our ability to predict consequences of these interactions for plant community composition and productivity under a variety of conditions. Future research will enable better prediction and mitigation of the consequences of human-induced global changes, improve efforts of restoration and conservation and promote sustainable provision of ecosystem services in a rapidly changing world.},

	abstract = {The most common system responses attributed to microfloral grazers (protozoa, nematodes, microarthropods) in the literature are increased plant growth, increased N uptake by plants, decreased or increased bacterial populations, increased CO2 evolution, increased N and P mineralization, and increased substrate utilization. Based on this evidence in the literature, a conceptual model was proposed in which microfloral grazers were considered as separate state variables. To help evaluate the model, the effects of microbivorous nematodes on microbial growth, nutrient cycling, plant growth, and nutrient uptake were examined with reference to activities within and outside of the rhizosphere. Blue grama grass (Bouteloua gracilis) was grown in gnotobiotic microcosms containing sandy loam soil low in inorganic N, with or without chitin amendments as a source of organic N. The soil was inoculated with bacteria (Pseudomonas paucimobilis or P. stutzeri) or fungus (Fusarium oxysporum), with half the bacterial microcosms inoculated with bacterial—feeding nematodes (Pelodera sp. or Acrobeloides sp.) and half the fungal microcosms inoculated with fungal—feeding nematodes (Aphelenchus avenae). Similar results were obtained from both the unamended and the chitin—amended experiments. Bacteria, fungi, and both trophic groups of nematodes were more abundant in the rhizosphere than in nonrhizosphere soil. All treatments containing nematodes and bacteria had higher bacterial densities than similar treatments without nematodes. Plants growing in soil with bacteria and bacterial—feeding nematodes grew faster and initially took up more N than plants in soil with only bacteria, because of increased N mineralization by bacteria, NH4+—N excretion by nematodes, and greater initial exploitation of soil by plant roots. Addition of fungal—feeding nematodes did not increase plant growth or N uptake because these nematodes excreted less NH4+—N than did bacterial—feeding nematode populations and because the N mineralized by the fungus alone was sufficient for plant growth. Total shoot P was significantly greater in treatments with fungus or Pelodera sp. than in the sterile plant control or treatments with plants plus Pseudomonas stutzeri until the end of the experiment. The additional mineralization that occurs due to the activities of microbial grazers may be significant for increasing plant growth only when mineralization by microflora alone is insufficient to meet the plants' requirements. However, while the advantage of increased N mineralization by microbial grazers may be short—term, it may occur in many ecosystems in those short periods of ideal conditions when plant growth can occur. Thus, these results support other claims in the literature that microbial grazers may perform important regulatory functions at critical times in the growth of plants.},

Smart gardeners know that soil is anything but an inert substance. Healthy soil is teeming with life, not just earthworms and insects, but a staggering multitude of bacteria, fungi, and other microorganisms. When we use chemical fertilizers, we injure the microbial life that sustains healthy plants and become increasingly dependent on an arsenal of artificial, often toxic, substances. But there is an alternative to this vicious cycle. We can garden in a way that strengthens the soil food web, the complex world of soil-dwelling organisms whose interactions create a nurturing environment for plants. The book extols the benefits of cultivating the soil food web. First, it clearly explains the activities and organisms that make up the web. Next, it explains how gardeners can cultivate the life of the soil through the use of compost, mulches, and compost tea. The revised edition updates the original text and includes two completely new chapters on mycorrhizae (beneficial associations fungi form with green-leaved plants) and archaea (single-celled organisms once thought to be allied to bacteria). With the author's help, everyone, from devotees of organic gardening techniques to weekend gardeners who simply want to grow healthy, vigorous plants without resorting to chemicals, can create rich, nurturing, living soil.},

	abstract = {This paper aims to provide guidance to ecologists with limited experience in spatial analysis to help in their choice of techniques. It uses examples to compare methods of spatial analysis for ecological field data. A taxonomy of different data types is presented, including point- and area-referenced data, with and without attributes. Spatially and non-spatially explicit data are distinguished. The effects of sampling and other transformations that convert one data type to another are discussed; the possible loss of spatial information is considered.  Techniques for analyzing spatial pattern, developed in plant ecology, animal ecology, landscape ecology, geostatistics and applied statistics are reviewed briefly and their overlap in methodology and philosophy noted. The techniques are categorized according to their output and the inferences that may be drawn from them, in a discursive style without formulae. Methods are compared for four case studies with field data covering a range of types. These are: 1) percentage cover of three shrubs along a line transect; 2) locations and volume of a desert plant in a 1 ha area; 3) a remotely-sensed spectral index and elevation from 105 km2 of a mountainous region; and 4) land cover from three rangeland types within 800 km2 of a coastal region. Initial approaches utilize mapping, frequency distributions and variance-mean indices. Analysis techniques we compare include: local quadrat variance, block quadrat variance, correlograms, variograms, angular correlation, directional variograms, wavelets, SADIE, nearest neighbour methods, Ripley's (t), and various landscape ecology metrics.  Our advice to ecologists is to use simple visualization techniques for initial analysis, and subsequently to select methods that are appropriate for the data type and that answer their specific questions of interest. It is usually prudent to employ several different techniques.},

A variety of data sets are used to construct global N budgets for 1860 and the early 1990s and to make projections for the global N budget in 2050. Regional N budgets for Asia, North America, and other major regions for the early 1990s, as well as the marine N budget, are presented to Highlight the dominant fluxes of nitrogen in each region. Important findings are that human activities increasingly dominate the N budget at the global and at most regional scales, the terrestrial and open ocean N budgets are essentially disconnected, and the fixed forms of N are accumulating in most environmental reservoirs. The largest uncertainties in our understanding of the N budget at most scales are the rates of natural biological nitrogen fixation, the amount of Nr storage in most environmental reservoirs, and the production rates of N2 by denitrification.},

Research for over two decades has resulted in a large literature, yet there is little consensus on the applicability or even the existence of general principles or broad considerations that could guide landscape conservation. We assess six major themes in the ecology and conservation of landscapes. We identify 13 important issues that need to be considered in developing approaches to landscape conservation. They include recognizing the importance of landscape mosaics (including the integration of terrestrial and aquatic areas), recognizing interactions between vegetation cover and vegetation configuration, using an appropriate landscape conceptual model, maintaining the capacity to recover from disturbance and managing landscapes in an adaptive framework. These considerations are influenced by landscape context, species assemblages and management goals and do not translate directly into on-the-ground management guidelines but they should be recognized by researchers and resource managers when developing guidelines for specific cases. Two crucial overarching issues are: (i) a clearly articulated vision for landscape conservation and (ii) quantifiable objectives that offer unambiguous signposts for measuring progress.},

In this paper, the Genetic Algorithms (GA) and Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) were used to simultaneously conduct calibration and uncertainty analysis for the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). In this combined method, several SWAT models with different structures are first selected; next GA is used to calibrate each model using observed streamflow data; finally, BMA is applied to combine the ensemble predictions and provide uncertainty interval estimation. This method was tested in two contrasting basins, the Little River Experimental Basin in Georgia, USA, and the Yellow River Headwater Basin in China. The results obtained in the two case studies show that this combined method can provide deterministic predictions better than or comparable to the best calibrated model using GA. The 66.7\% and 90\% uncertainty intervals estimated by this method were analyzed. The differences between the percentage of coverage of observations and the corresponding expected coverage percentage are within 10\% for both calibration and validation periods in these two test basins. This combined methodology provides a practical and flexible tool to attain reliable deterministic simulation and uncertainty analysis of SWAT.},

He argues that centrally managed social plans derail when they impose schematic visions that do violence to complex interdependencies that are not - and cannot be - fully understood. Further the success of designs for social organization depends on the recognition that local, practical knowledge is as important as formal, epistemic knowledge. The author builds a persuasive case against "development theory" and imperialistic state planning that disregards the values, desires, and objections of its subjects. And in discussing these planning disasters, he identifies four conditions common to them all: the state's attempt to impose administrative order on nature and society; a high-modernist ideology that believes scientific intervention can improve every aspect of human life; a willingness to use authoritarian state power to effect large-scale innovations; and a prostrate civil society that cannot effectively resist such plans.},

However, they are often used inappropriately, leading to false conclusions about ecological patterns and processes, which has prompted recent strong criticism of the approach. Here, we evaluate when chronosequences may or may not be appropriate for studying community and ecosystem development. 2. Chronosequences are appropriate to study plant succession at decadal to millennial time-scales when there is evidence that sites of different ages are following the same trajectory. They can also be reliably used to study aspects of soil development that occur between temporally linked sites over time-scales of centuries to millennia, sometimes independently of their application to shorter-term plant and soil biological communities. 3. Some characteristics of changing plant and soil biological communities (e.g. species richness, plant cover, vegetation structure, soil organic matter accumulation) are more likely to be related in a predictable and temporally linear manner than are other characteristics (e.g. species composition and abundance) and are therefore more reliably studied using a chronosequence approach. 4. Chronosequences are most appropriate for studying communities that are following convergent successional trajectories and have low biodiversity, rapid species turnover and low frequency and severity of disturbance. Chronosequences are least suitable for studying successional trajectories that are divergent, species-rich, highly disturbed or arrested in time because then there are often major difficulties in determining temporal linkages between stages. 5. Synthesis. We conclude that, when successional trajectories exceed the life span of investigators and the experimental and observational studies that they perform, temporal change can be successfully explored through the judicious use of chronosequences.},

The chapter concludes with a discussion of advanced methods, including methods for reducing random walk behaviour.

Although such losses are widely viewed as an ethical and aesthetic problem, recent research reveals extensive cascading effects of their disappearance in marine, terrestrial, and freshwater ecosystems worldwide. This empirical work supports long-standing theory about the role of top-down forcing in ecosystems but also highlights the unanticipated impacts of trophic cascades on processes as diverse as the dynamics of disease, wildfire, carbon sequestration, invasive species, and biogeochemical cycles. These findings emphasize the urgent need for interdisciplinary research to forecast the effects of trophic downgrading on process, function, and resilience in global ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Plants often impact the rate of native soil organic matter turnover through root interactions with soil organisms; however the role of root-microbial interactions in mediation of the “priming effect” is not well understood. We examined the effects of living plant roots and N fertilization on belowground C dynamics in a California annual grassland soil (Haploxeralf) during a two-year greenhouse study. The fate of 13C-labeled belowground C (roots and organic matter) was followed under planted (Avena barbata) and unplanted conditions, and with and without supplemental N (20 kg N ha−1 season−1) over two periods of plant growth, each followed by a dry, fallow period of 120 d. Turnover of belowground 13C SOM was followed using 13C-phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) biomarkers. Living roots increased the turnover and loss of belowground 13C compared with unplanted soils. Planted soils had 20\% less belowground 13C present than in unplanted soils after 2 cycles of planting and fallow. After 2 treatment cycles, unlabeled soil C was 4.8\% higher in planted soils than unplanted. The addition of N to soils decreased the turnover of enriched belowground 13C during the first treatment season in both planted and unplanted soils, however no effect of N was observed thereafter. Our findings suggest that A. barbata may increase soil C levels over time because root and exudate C inputs are significant, but that increase will be moderated by an overall faster C mineralization rate of belowground C. N addition may slow soil C losses; however, the effect was minor and transient in this system. The labeled root-derived 13C was initially recovered in gram negative (highest enrichment), gram positive, and fungal biomarkers. With successive growing seasons, the labeled C in the gram negative and fungal markers declined, while gram positive markers continued to accumulate labeled belowground C. The rhizosphere of A. barbata shifted the microbial community composition, resulting in greater abundances of gram negative markers and lower abundances of gram positive, actinobacteria and cyclopropyl PLFA markers compared to unplanted soil. However, the longer-term utilization of labeled belowground C by gram positive bacteria was enhanced in the rhizosphere microbial community compared with unplanted soils. We suggest that the activities of gram positive bacteria may be major controllers of multi-year rhizosphere-related priming of SOM decomposition.},

	doi = {10.1109/ICMLA.2012.218},
	abstract = {Social media sites are now the most popular destination for Internet users, providing social scientists with a great opportunity to understand online behaviour. There are a growing number of research papers related to social media, a small number of which focus on personality prediction. To date, studies have typically focused on the Big Five traits of personality, but one area which is relatively unexplored is that of the anti-social traits of narcissism, Machiavellians and psychopathy, commonly referred to as the Dark Triad. This study explored the extent to which it is possible to determine anti-social personality traits based on Twitter use. This was performed by comparing the Dark Triad and Big Five personality traits of 2,927 Twitter users with their profile attributes and use of language. Analysis shows that there are some statistically significant relationships between these variables. Through the use of crowd sourced machine learning algorithms, we show that machine learning provides useful prediction rates, but is imperfect in predicting an individual's Dark Triad traits from Twitter activity. While predictive models may be unsuitable for predicting an individual's personality, they may still be of practical importance when models are applied to large groups of people, such as gaining the ability to see whether anti-social traits are increasing or decreasing over a population. Our results raise important questions related to the unregulated use of social media analysis for screening purposes. It is important that the practical and ethical implications of drawing conclusions about personal information embedded in social media sites are better understood.},

This has led to extensive eutrophication of fresh waters and coastal zones as well as increased inventories of the potent greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O). Microbial processes will ultimately restore balance to the nitrogen cycle, but the damage done by humans to the nitrogen economy of the planet will persist for decades, possibly centuries, if active intervention and careful management strategies are not initiated.},

	abstract = {Marine ecosystems are centrally important to the biology of the planet, yet a comprehensive understanding of how anthropogenic climate change is affecting them has been poorly developed. Recent studies indicate that rapidly rising greenhouse gas concentrations are driving ocean systems toward conditions not seen for millions of years, with an associated risk of fundamental and irreversible ecological transformation. The impacts of anthropogenic climate change so far include decreased ocean productivity, altered food web dynamics, reduced abundance of habitat-forming species, shifting species distributions, and a greater incidence of disease. Although there is considerable uncertainty about the spatial and temporal details, climate change is clearly and fundamentally altering ocean ecosystems. Further change will continue to create enormous challenges and costs for societies worldwide, particularly those in developing countries.},

	abstract = {The Clackamas River is an approximately 83-mile (134 km) tributary of the Willamette River in northwestern Oregon, in the United States. Draining an area of about 940 square miles (2,435 km2), the Clackamas flows through mostly forested and rugged mountainous terrain in its upper reaches, and passes agricultural and urban areas in its lower third. The river rises in eastern Marion County, about 55 miles (89 km) east-southeast of Salem. The headwaters are on the slopes of Olallie Butte in the Mount Hood National Forest, about 10 miles (16 km) north of Mount Jefferson, at an elevation of 4,909 feet (1,496 m) in the Cascade Range. The Clackamas flows briefly north and then flows northwest through the mountains, passing through North Fork Reservoir and Estacada. It then emerges from the mountains southeast of Portland. It joins the Willamette near Oregon City and forms the boundary between Oregon City and Gladstone.
The Clackamas provides hydroelectric power and drinking water for some of the Portland metropolitan area, and it supports runs of Coho salmon, spring and fall Chinook salmon, and summer and winter steelhead. The river's old-growth forests, its habitat for several species of birds, its healthy fish runs, and the recreational opportunities that it provides—such as fishing and whitewater rafting—led to the designation of more than half of the length of the river into the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System (NWSRS). This environment also allowed Native Americans to settle in the river's basin as early as 10,000 years ago.
Regulation of the river began in 1905 with the Cazadero Dam. In 1912, the River Mill Dam intercepted wood and coarse sediment. Later dams at North Fork, Oak Grove, Stone Creek, and Timothy Lake also intercepted wood sediment on the lower river.},

	abstract = {Ecosystem productivity commonly increases asymptotically with plant species diversity, and determining the mechanisms responsible for this well-known pattern is essential to predict potential changes in ecosystem productivity with ongoing species loss. Previous studies attributed the asymptotic diversity–productivity pattern to plant competition and differential resource use (e.g., niche complementarity). Using an analytical model and a series of experiments, we demonstrate theoretically and empirically that host-specific soil microbes can be major determinants of the diversity–productivity relationship in grasslands. In the presence of soil microbes, plant disease decreased with increasing diversity, and productivity increased nearly 500\%, primarily because of the strong effect of density-dependent disease on productivity at low diversity. Correspondingly, disease was higher in plants grown in conspecific-trained soils than heterospecific-trained soils (demonstrating host-specificity), and productivity increased and host-specific disease decreased with increasing community diversity, suggesting that disease was the primary cause of reduced productivity in species-poor treatments. In sterilized, microbe-free soils, the increase in productivity with increasing plant species number was markedly lower than the increase measured in the presence of soil microbes, suggesting that niche complementarity was a weaker determinant of the diversity–productivity relationship. Our results demonstrate that soil microbes play an integral role as determinants of the diversity–productivity relationship.},

	abstract = {"Agent-based modeling is a new technique for understanding how the dynamics of biological, social, and other complex systems arise from the characteristics and behaviors of the agents making up these systems. This innovative textbook gives students and scientists the skills to design, implement, and analyze agent-based models. It starts with the fundamentals of modeling and provides an introduction to NetLogo, an easy-to-use, free, and powerful software platform. Nine chapters then each introduce an important modeling concept and show how to implement it using NetLogo. The book goes on to present strategies for finding the right level of model complexity and developing theory for agent behavior, and for analyzing and learning from models. Agent-Based and Individual-Based Modeling features concise and accessible text, numerous examples, and exercises using small but scientific models. The emphasis throughout is on analysis--such as software testing, theory development, robustness analysis, and understanding full models--and on design issues like optimizing model structure and finding good parameter values. The first hands-on introduction to agent-based modeling, from conceptual design to computer implementation to parameterization and analysis Filled with examples and exercises, with updates and supplementary materials at www.railsback-grimm-abm-book.com Designed for students and researchers across the biological and social sciences Written by leading practitioners "--},

This review describes recent advances in elucidating the role of root exudates in interactions between plant roots and other plants, microbes, and nematodes present in the rhizosphere. Evidence indicating that root exudates may take part in the signaling events that initiate the execution of these interactions is also presented. Various positive and negative plant-plant and plant-microbe interactions are highlighted and described from the molecular to the ecosystem scale. Furthermore, methodologies to address these interactions under laboratory conditions are presented. [Addendum]},

	abstract = {Intensive land use reduces the diversity and abundance of many soil biota, with consequences for the processes that they govern and the ecosystem services that these processes underpin. Relationships between soil biota and ecosystem processes have mostly been found in laboratory experiments and rarely are found in the field. Here, we quantified, across four countries of contrasting climatic and soil conditions in Europe, how differences in soil food web composition resulting from land use systems (intensive wheat rotation, extensive rotation, and permanent grassland) influence the functioning of soils and the ecosystem services that they deliver. Intensive wheat rotation consistently reduced the biomass of all components of the soil food web across all countries. Soil food web properties strongly and consistently predicted processes of C and N cycling across land use systems and geographic locations, and they were a better predictor of these processes than land use. Processes of carbon loss increased with soil food web properties that correlated with soil C content, such as earthworm biomass and fungal/bacterial energy channel ratio, and were greatest in permanent grassland. In contrast, processes of N cycling were explained by soil food web properties independent of land use, such as arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and bacterial channel biomass. Our quantification of the contribution of soil organisms to processes of C and N cycling across land use systems and geographic locations shows that soil biota need to be included in C and N cycling models and highlights the need to map and conserve soil biodiversity across the world.},

	abstract = {The United States National Forest System supplies much of the nation's drinking water. However, changes in climate, land use and population are stressing the ability of these forests to provide that ecosystem service. Federal land managers are under increasing pressure to increase ecosystem carbon sequestration in an attempt to partially offset greenhouse gases and slow global warming. Unfortunately, the positive relationship between carbon gain and water use in forests, puts the need for water and increased carbon gain at odds with each other. To assess these tradeoffs, a coupled water supply and demand, carbon sequestration, and biodiversity (WaSSI-CB) model was developed. WaSSI-CB was designed to be run with climate, population, and land use change scenarios to examine the interactions between water, carbon gain and biodiversity change across the 2,100 USGS 8 digit USGS Hydrologic Unit Code watersheds that span the lower 48 US. Results from this model using historic climate and landuse data indicated that the greatest increases in water use conservation may be made through improved irrigation practices, that manipulations in forest cover (i.e., massive harvesting) are an impractical way of increasing water supply, and the that the southeastern US has the highest potential for forest carbon sequestration. Biodiversity was calculated under steady state, historic conditions, with the greatest and mammal biodiversity occurring the southern US. The impact of future climate and population change were not included in this paper due to space limitations, but will be presented at the conference.},

"The revised and updated Currency edition of this business classic contains over one hundred pages of new material based on interviews with dozens of practitioners at companies like BP, Unilever, Intel, Ford, HP, Saudi Aramco, and organizations like Roca, Oxfam, and The World Bank. It features a new Foreword about the success Peter Senge has achieved with learning organizations since the book's inception, as well as new chapters on Impetus (getting started), Strategies, Leaders' New Work, Systems Citizens, and Frontiers for the Future."–BOOK JACKET.},

Models that link yields of the four largest commodity crops to weather indicate that global maize and wheat production declined by 3.8 and 5.5\%, respectively, relative to a counterfactual without climate trends. For soybeans and rice, winners and losers largely balanced out.

A temporal partition (time-delay coarse graining of the phase space based on the symbol sequence statistics) is introduced with little if any intervention required for the targeting of the trajectory. Message transmission is performed by means of codeword, i.e., specific targeting instructions are sent to the receiver rather than the explicit message. This approach yields (i) error correction availability for transmission in the presence of noise or dropouts, (ii) transmission in a compressed format, (iii) a high level of security against undesirable detection, and (iv) language recognition.},

Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, in which plausible values for unknown quantities are simulated from their appropriate probability distribution, have revolutionised the practice of statistics. For more than 20 years the BUGS project has been at the forefront of this movement. The BUGS project began in Cambridge, in 1989, just as Alan Gelfand and Adrian Smith were working 80 miles away in Nottingham on their classic Gibbs sampler paper (Gelfand and Smith, 1990) that kicked off the revolution. But we never communicated (except through the intermediate node of David Clayton) and whereas the Gelfand-Smith approach used image-processing as inspiration, the philosophy behind BUGS was rooted more in techniques for handling uncertainty in artificial intelligence using directed graphical models and what came to be called Bayesian networks (Pearl, 1988). Lunn et al. (2009b) lay out all this history in greater detail. Some people have accused Markov chain Monte Carlo methods of being slow, but nothing could compare with the time it has taken this book to be written! The first proposal dates from 1995, but things got in the way, as they do, and it needed a vigorous new generation of researchers to finally get it finished. It is slightly galling that much of the current book could have been written in the mid-1990s, since the basic ideas of the software, the language for model description, and indeed some of the examples are unchanged. Nevertheless there have been important developments in the extended gestational period of the book, for example techniques for model criticism and comparison, implementation of differential equations and nonparametric techniques, and the ability to run BUGS code within a range of alternative programs"–},

	abstract = {The impact of elevated CO2 on leaf-litter and root exudate production may alter soil carbon storage capacities for the future. In particular when so-called ‘priming effects’, the counterintuitive loss of soil carbon following input of organic carbon substrates, are taken into consideration. Here we investigate the dynamics of priming effects and ask whether the source of primed carbon is microbial biomass or soil organic matter and whether specific microbial groups, as identified by phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) biomarkers, may be important in causing them. We measured δ13C within soil CO2 efflux and PLFA biomarkers following C3 soil priming effects caused by additions of C4 sugar-cane sucrose and maize (Zea mays L.) leaf-litter chopped and ground. All additions caused an initial pulse of priming effect CO2 and a later pulse of substrate-derived CO2, showing that priming effects can be induced rapidly following changes in substrate supply. Priming effects persisted over 32 days and led to a loss of soil carbon, with an increase in soil carbon decomposition of 169\% following sucrose addition, 44\% following chopped maize and 67\% following ground maize additions. An increased concentration of soil-derived carbon within specific PLFA biomarkers provided evidence that a source of the primed carbon was soil organic matter. Certain Gram negative bacteria, identified by PLFA biomarkers (16:1ω5, 16:1ω7), showed increased uptake of soil carbon for both sucrose and maize treatments and may be directly linked to priming effects. Our study provides evidence that substrate carbon inputs to soil induce rapid changes in specific microbial groups, which in turn increase soil carbon metabolism.},

Issues related to water supply, water quality, and degradation of aquatic environments are reported on frequently. The interaction of ground water and surface water has been shown to be a significant concern in many of these issues. Contaminated aquifers that discharge to streams can result in long-term contamination of surface water; conversely, streams can be a major source of contamination to aquifers. Surface water commonly is hydraulically connected to ground water, but the interactions are difficult to observe and measure. The purpose of this report is to present our current understanding of these processes and activities as well as limitations in our knowledge and ability to characterize them.},

They are sufficiently large to be identifiable by light microscopy and sufficiently small to inhabit water films surrounding soil particles. They aggregate around and in food sources. They include component taxa of the soil food web at several trophic levels. They can be categorized into functional guilds whose members respond similarly to food web enrichment and to environmental perturbation and recovery. Indices derived through nematode faunal analysis provide bioindicators for disturbance of the soil environment and condition of the soil food web. We enhance the resolution of faunal analyses by providing a weighting system for the indicator importance of the presence and abundance of each functional guild in relation to enrichment and structure of the food web. Graphical representations of food web structure, based on nematode faunal analyses, allow diagnostic interpretation of its condition. Simple ratios of the weighted abundance of representatives of specific functional guilds provide useful indicators of food web structure, enrichment, and decomposition channels.},

	abstract = {Aboveground biomass is a key variable in understanding the role of tropical forests in the global carbon cycle. The forests of the Yucatan Peninsula form part of the largest remaining tract of Mesoamerican forests, where the predominant land use is still slash-and-burn agriculture. Previous estimates of aboveground live phytomass of late-successional forests in this region vary almost twofold, but are derived from relatively few forest plots. We estimate aboveground forest biomass using data from 243 inventoried forest plots (totalling 58.5 ha), ranging across a disturbance gradient from nearly intact to severely degraded forests. We assess the effects of environmental and disturbance variables on forest basal area, stand-level wood specific gravity and aboveground biomass. Major differences in basal area and aboveground biomass were explained by levels of human disturbance (clear-cutting, logging, and fire disturbance), whereas edaphic factors played only a minor role. Total mean phytomass density estimates ranged from 28.8 ± 3.8 mg ha−1 in plots aged 10–15 years to 191.9 ± 9.5 mg ha−1 in undisturbed old-growth forest plots (\&gt;50 years). Severe logging and fire disturbance reduced AGB in late-successional plots (30–50 years) by 36\% and 37\%, respectively. Stand-level wood specific gravity increased with succession, due to an increase in the proportion of total basal area contributed by high wood density genera. Logging intensity had a small additional effect on stand-level wood specific gravity. Incorporating stand-level wood specific gravity into the algorithm explained only an additional 4\% of the variation in estimates of aboveground biomass, which was largely determined by basal area. However, ignoring plot-level variation in wood specific gravity resulted in overestimates of 19\% in plots aged 10–15 years. Our aboveground biomass estimates were highly comparable with previous studies using the same allometric equations, and fell within the highest range of estimates reported for tropical dry forests. Forest of this region still retains a significant carbon stock, but rates of biomass recovery (2.8 ± 0.2S.E. mg ha−1 year−1) were low compared to other neotropical forests.},

	abstract = {A variety of organic materials (e.g. composts, paper recycling wastes, hay) can be used as in-row mulches in perennial horticultural cropping systems such as high density apple orchards. As organic materials with variable properties, such mulches can be expected to have variable effects on structure of the soil food web and mineralisation of N and P in the root zone. The overall objectives of this study were to: (1) assess the effects of a selection of organic mulches on the abundance of protozoa and nematode trophic groups; (2) use the model of Hunt et al. [Biol. Fertil. Soils 3 (1987) 393] to assess the implications of changes in microfaunal abundance for microbial turnover and N mineralisation; and (3) determine effects of the mulches on nematode indicators of increased microbial production/turnover and functional diversity of the soil food web. Organic mulch treatments commenced in 1994 and included shredded office paper, municipal biosolids, shredded paper applied over municipal biosolids, shredded paper applied over municipal compost, alfalfa hay, and black polyethylene fabric. The control was conventional tree-row weed management with glyphosate. Biosolids and municipal compost treatments were re-applied in 1997. Protozoan abundance was determined in 1998, 1999 and 2000. Nematode community structure was assessed in 1998, 1999, and twice in 2000. Nematode community parameters evaluated included: abundance of bacterivorous, fungivorous, omnivorous and predacious nematodes; abundance of the root-lesion nematode, Pratylenchus penetrans; absolute and relative abundances of enrichment opportunist nematodes (Rhabditidae+Diplogasteridae+Panagrolaimidae); Simpson’s diversity; evenness; and the indices of nematode community enrichment (EI) and structure (SI) described by Ferris et al. [Appl. Soil Ecol. 18 (2001) 13]. Measurements of the abundance of enrichment opportunists and the EI were evaluated as indicators of enhanced nutrient fluxes. Diversity and the SI were evaluated as indicators of changes in functional diversity of the soil food web.

The abundance of protozoa and bacterivorous nematodes, and estimated fluxes of N and P through the microfauna, were greater under all combinations of biosolids or municipal compost and shredded paper than under the control and plastic mulch. The abundance of enrichment opportunist nematodes and the EI were also consistently greater under combinations of biosolids or municipal compost and shredded paper. The abundance of enrichment opportunists and EI were both also correlated with leaf P, providing additional evidence to support the use of these parameters as indicators of enhanced turnover of microbial biomass and nutrients. The SI was greatest under shredded paper and shredded paper applied over municipal compost, and least under municipal biosolids and alfalfa hay. Population densities of P. penetrans were reduced under shredded paper mulch relative to the control and biosolids alone.},

	abstract = {Hurricanes are an important part of the natural disturbance regime of the Yucatán Peninsula with the potential to alter forest structure and composition, yet investigations of species-level responses to severe winds are limited in this region. The effect of a category 5 hurricane (Hurricane Dean, 21 August 2007) on dry tropical forests across the southern Yucatán was examined with respect to tree damage, mortality, and sprouting. Damage was assessed 9–11 mo following the hurricane in 92 (500 m2) plots stratified by wind speed and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) change classes over a 25,000 km2 study area. We investigated the relative importance of biotic (i.e., species, size, and wood density) and abiotic (i.e., wind speed) factors to better explain patterns of damage. Overall mortality was low (3.9\%), however, mortality of less common species (8.5\%) was elevated more than fourfold above that of 28 common species (1.8\%), indicating immediate selective consequences for community composition. Species varied in the degree and type of damage experienced, with susceptibility increasing with tree diameter and height. Wood density influenced damage patterns only in areas where a critical threshold in storm intensity was exceeded (wind speeds ≥210 km/h). Although overall, damage severity increased with wind speed, common coastal species were more resistant to damage than species distributed farther inland. Our findings suggest that selective pressure exerted by frequent hurricane disturbance has, and will, continue to impact the floristic composition of forests on the Yucatán Peninsula, favoring certain wind-resistant species.

	abstract = {This chapter helps in understanding the role of soil fauna in soil function. Soils host an extremely diverse community of invertebrates that differ in their adaptive strategies and hence in the functions they fulfill in soils. The chapter illustrates the functional classification of soil organisms based on their adaptive strategies. Three major groups of invertebrates may be defined based on the nature of the relationship that they develop with soil microflora. The microfauna comprise invertebrates of less than 0.2 mm on an average, makes use of micro-organisms mainly through predation in micro-foodweb systems. Mesofauna and large arthropods comprise the group of litter transformers. Earthworms, termites and, to a lesser extent, ants, are “ecosystem engineers” that create diverse organo-mineral structures. It is suggested that the three systems defined, operate at nested scales of time and space and have decreasing overall effects on the determination of soil function in the order micro-foodwebs \&lt; litter transformers \&lt; ecosystem engineers. Modifications of soil fauna communities may lead to loss of diversity and result in loss of functions when specific structural patterns or regulation mechanisms are lost.},
