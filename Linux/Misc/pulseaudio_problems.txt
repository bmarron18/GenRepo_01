========= pulsaudio and sound cloud files =============


One obvious difference is that I installed pulseaudio-git because pulseaudio broke on me. It builds relatively fast, so you could try that.

I think you could try pulseaudio --kill


Check if any pulseaudio instance is running :

pulseaudio --check

It normally prints no output, just exit code. 0 means running. Mine were not running, so I just advanced to step 3.

If any instance is running :

pulseaudio -k

Finally, start pulseaudio again as a daemon :

pulseaudio -D




$ pulseaudio --check --verbose
I: [pulseaudio] main.c: Daemon running as PID 8391


missing codecs?
