\begin{letter}{Austen Ruzicka}
\opening{}
Austen Ruzicka has been employed as a C\# programmer for the LANDIS-II Updates Project for over nine months. During this time Austen has been an exceptionally reliable and dependable employee and proven himself to be a highly capable and creative problem solver. His command of C\# and use of Visual Studio are excellent and his ability to translate (often vague) requests and troubleshoot input/output issues is superb. He can readily generate creative options and iteratively experiment until a workable or desired solution is found. On more than one occasion he has \enquote{scratch-built} scripts and created code snippets to provide extended functionalities for our project's rather complex modeling environment. Additionally, he is willing to produce well-documented code and follow standardized QAQC protocols. \\

Austen is quiet, sincere, and hard-working. He has been a tremendous asset to our project and Dr. Rob Scheller, our project director, has referred to Austen as a member of our "crack team of programmers." I highly recommend Austen; he will be a tremendous asset to your team.
