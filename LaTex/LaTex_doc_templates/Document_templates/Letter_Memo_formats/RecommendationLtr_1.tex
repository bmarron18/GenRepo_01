\begin{letter}{Dr. Wayne Wakeland}
\opening{}

Dr. Wayne Wakeland is absolutely deserving of the George C. Hoffman award: he is an engaging instructor, a stalwart supporter of Portland State University (PSU), an invaluable resource for students, and a solid researcher.  Dr. Wakeland invites students to explore non-traditional scientific perspectives to help them become more effective problem solvers. Over the last few years he has not only created new courses and made many of them available on-line, but has pushed a larger curriculum agenda to ensure that all PSU students have the opportunity to enrich their scientific toolkits. For decades Dr. Wakeland has supported PSU not only by serving on various faculty committees and subcommittees, but by tirelessly maintaining the Systems Science program. The Systems Science program is a unique attribute of PSU and continues to attract national as well as international doctoral and masters students and scholars. Dr. Wakeland's most outstanding contribution, however, is as a student mentor. He has chaired 23 Systems Science dissertation or masters thesis committees, served as member of 69 Systems Science doctoral dissertation thesis committees, served as a dissertation committee member for students from various departments throughout PSU as well as for students from other universities, and has helped prepare students for research by serving on over 130 comprehensive exam committees. Dr. Wakeland is upbeat, available, and consistently helps students find the most expedient path to realize their academic and life goals. His support for students is remarkable and he has a knack for finding practical solutions to problems, especially those involving the \enquote{red tape} that must necessarily accompany academic pursuits.

\newpage
I have known Wayne for nearly five years and he has helped me tremendously not only with matters of science and its application to real-world problems, but also with sorting out the pathways that lead to living an effective life and defining a rewarding career. He is simply wonderful and I highly recommend him for this distinguished service award.\\

Thank you.
