%HAND-DELIVERED
\opening{Dear SSA,}

Thanks for requesting updated information about my work earnings for 2021. I have completed and signed the Earnings Estimate Form (see enclosed). As documented in the signed form, there has been a slight increment in earnings as compared to the original earnings estimate stated in my benefits application; that is, \\
\begin{enumerate}
  \item My employment with the State of Oregon ended on May 31, 2021.
  \item I have not worked since my Oregon employment ended on May 31, 2021.
  \item My original estimate for yearly (gross) earnings in 2021 was \textbf{\$37500 USD}.
  \item My actual (gross) earnings from January 1, 2021 through May 31, 2021 totaled \textbf{\$45934 USD}, which includes monies from a step raise plus vacation days paid out upon termination of employment.
  \item My yearly (gross) earnings for 2021 will be \textbf{\$45934 USD}.
  \item I will not work for the remainder of 2021.
\end{enumerate}

Your request for information also provides an opportunity to update you about my current situation, contact information, and plans for the remainder of 2021 as well as for 2022. After leaving Oregon in June of this year, I traveled to Albuquerque, NM to visit family and set up a residence with my son, Shawn and his wife Carolina. In late June I traveled to Mexico and have decided to stay in Mexico City at least through May 2022. I am currently a legal, temporary resident of Mexico. This means I can travel freely between Mexico and the US while keeping my US citizenship and passport. I also am registered with the Global Entry Program (Membership ID \#158242866). In Mexico City I have rented an apartment and opened a bank account.  I also have a Mexican phone and phone number. These new contact data are given below. 

I am currently completing a 120-hr TEFL course through UC Berkeley and may decide to stay in Mexico somewhat permanently and teach English during the next school year (Aug 2022 - Jun 2023). Should I choose to do so, I will certainly update you regarding earned income and residence. I am also studying tango (phew!) and getting back to serious music practice, composition, and hopefully soon, performance. \\

I cannot thank you enough for providing a base income that allows me to "retire" into a life in the arts. Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!

\closing{Sincerely,}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
