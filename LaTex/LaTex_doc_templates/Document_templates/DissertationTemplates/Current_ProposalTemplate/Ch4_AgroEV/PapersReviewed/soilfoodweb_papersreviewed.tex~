\section{Models}
%========================================
\shortcite{scheller_forest_2004}
\begin{itemize}
  \item short list of ecosystem processes ==> Ecosystem processes (e.g., net primary productivity, decomposition) (p 211)
  \item Keep it simple ==> Based on our objectives and the computational limitations of complex landscape simulations, the biomass module was designed to minimize complexity. Biomass is calculated using a low number of parameters that can be estimated across an entire landscape (p. 213)
  \item chose to keep cohort structure and add state variables ==> We elected to preserve the existing cohort data structure, as it has been well validated and integrated with various disturbance modules, and add new state variables that supplement the existing data and allow aboveground living and dead woody biomass calculations.
  \item BiomassSuccession misses soil food web carbon and does not estimate belowground root mass ==> Biomass that is incorporated into the soil layer (soil organic carbon, SOC) was not modeled. (p. 214)
  \item All simulated mortality events (the death of a species-age cohort) either transferred the living biomass for a cohort to the dead biomass pool (in the case of fire or wind) or removed the living biomass from the system (in the case of harvesting). (p. 214)
  
  \item 1st major assumption ==> The principle assumption was that an equilibrium condition would develop after many decades, whereas a cohort's mortality would equal growth, and [aboveground living biomass for each cohort = ($B_{ij}$)] biomass would cease to increase. (p. 214) 
  \item 1st major assumption ==> Linear relationship: $B_{ij_{t+1}} = B_{ij} + ANPP_{ij} - M_{ij} \ \ i = spp ,\ j= age, \ ij=spp-age \ cohort \ (bin) $
  \item 1st major assumption ==> 
  \item 2nd major assumption ==> ... at the long time steps (10 years) modeled, disturbance does not significantly decrease maximum potential productivity by reducing available soil nitrogen. (p. 214)
  \item 2nd major assumption ==> impact on SFWs for logging/windthrow seems ok; fire damages soil fungus but on average might be ok
  \item 3rd major assumption ==> ... (species-age) cohort biomass data implicitly incorporates density information. Density was not explicitly calculated for either our growth or mortality functions. reductions in density over time are difficult to predict in mixed-species,mixed-age forests. Future research will explore variation in initial biomass as a function of seed rain and initial density.(p. 214)
  \item $ANPP_{max}$ estimated a variety of ways ==> expert knowledge, Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data, gap models, ecosystem process models (p. 215) ... maximum aboveground biomass (AGB) is now an input parameter....the relationship between above ground net primary productivity (ANPP) and AGB is not linear beyond $\sim 10 Mg \ ha^{-1} yr^{-1}$.... separate input for maximum AGB better accommodates shrubs and grasses that have different relationships between ANPP and AGB (p. 5 Biomass Succession v3.5 User Guide)
  \item 
\end{itemize}

%===========================================

\section{Ecological networks}
%============================================
\shortcite{williams_simple_2010} Simple MaxEnt models explain food web degree distributions
\begin{itemize}
  \item the MaxEnt models shows that, in many food webs, one does not need to consider detailed ecological processes to be able to predict the consumer, resource, or undirected degree distributions. While many features of food webs are clearly nonrandom and require an ecological explanation, their degree distributions are largely explainable by a simple null model based in statistical rather than ecological theory (p. )
\end{itemize}


\shortcite{fath_ecological_2007} Ecological network analysis: network construction
\begin{itemize}
  \item assumption --- it is necessary that the network model be a partition of the environment being studied, i.e., be mutually exclusive and exhaustive
  \item blasts reductionist approach ---  network models aim to include all ecological compartments and interactions and the analysis determines the overall relationships and significance of each. The difficulty of course lies in obtaining the data necessary to quantify all the ecological compartments and interactions. When sufficient data sets are not available, simple algorithms, called community assembly rules, have been employed to construct realistic food webs to test various food web theories. Once the network is constructed, via data or algorithms, the ENA is quite straightforward and software is available to assist in this (p.  )
\end{itemize}


\shortcite{bascompte_disentangling_2009}
\begin{itemize}
  \item These [mutually beneficial] interactions play a major role in the generation and maintenance of biodiversity on Earth and organize communities around a network of mutual dependences. (p. 417)
  \item mutualistic networks are (i) heterogeneous, in which the bulk of species interact with a few species, and  a few species have a much higher number of interactions than would be expected from chance alone; (ii) nested, in which specialists interact with a subset of the group of species that generalists interact with; and (iii) built on weak and asymmetric links among species (for example, in some cases when a plant interacts strongly with an animal, the animal tends to depend less on the plant) (14). Therefore, mutualistic networks are neither randomly organized nor organized in isolated compartments, but built cohesively around a core of generalist species. (p 417)
  \item the nested structure of mutualistic networks maximizes the number of coexisting species (p 418)
  \item Studies such as (A) focus on coevolution at a community scale and set the foundation for predicting how global change will propagate through such networks. Studies such as (B) provide a framework to address the simultaneous influence of all patches on gene flow and quantify the importance of a single patch for the persistence of the entire metapopulation.
\end{itemize}

\section{Books}
%=======================
\shortcite{harte_maximum_2011} Maximum Entropy and Ecology
\begin{itemize}
  \item the concept of information theory can be applied to arbitrary prob dist. (p 123)
  \item MaxEnt has been used to infer the distribution of numbers of linkages between nodes in an ecological web. (p. 135)
\end{itemize}

\shortcite{gianinazzi_impact_1994}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Plant health and productivity are rooted in the soil, and the quality of the soil depends on the diversity and viability of its biota (p. 119)
  \item Tisdall and Oades (1979) first reported that aggregate stability and AMF status are related in ag soils (p. 119)
  \item ... pioneering work by Tisdall and Oades (1979, 1980) on the relationships between crop rotation, fallowing, and soil stability, showing a connection between the extent of the soil mycelium and macroaggregate formation and stabilization by arbuscular mycorrhizal roots (p. 120)
  \item ... root and fungus effects are difficult to separate but that the soil mycelium alone is capable to bring about soil effects equivalent to those of roots, while roots and fungi together affect soil aggregation synergistically (p. 120)  
\end{itemize}
