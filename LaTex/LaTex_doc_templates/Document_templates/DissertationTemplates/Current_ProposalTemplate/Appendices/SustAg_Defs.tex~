\section{A Few Definitions of Sustainable Agriculture}
\subsubsection{The US Congress idea}
Sec. 3103. Definitions.\\
(19) The term “sustainable agriculture” means an integrated system of plant and animal production practices having a site-specific application that will, over the long-term —
(A) satisfy human food and fiber needs;\\
(B) enhance environmental quality and the natural resource base upon which the agriculture economy depends;\\
(C) make the most efficient use of nonrenewable resources and on-farm resources and integrate, where appropriate, natural biological cycles and controls;\\
(D) sustain the economic viability of farm operations; and\\
(E) enhance the quality of life for farmers and society as a whole.\\
7 U.S.C. \S 3103(19)

\subsubsection{The USDA idea}
Sustainable agriculture is "a way of practicing agriculture which seeks to optimize skills and technology to achieve long-term stability of  the agricultural enterprise, environmental protection, and consumer safety. It is achieved through management strategies which help the producer select hybrids and varieties, soil conserving cultural practices, soil fertility programs, and pest management programs. The goal of sustainable agriculture is to minimize adverse impacts to the immediate and off-farm environments while providing a sustained level of production and profit. Sound resource conservation is an integral part of the means to achieve sustainable agriculture." \\

\subsubsection{The EU idea (the 'Evergreen Revolution')}
Sustainable agriculture aims to:\\
Produce safe and healthy food\\
Conserve natural resources\\
Ensure economic viability of farmlands\\
Deliver services for the ecosystem and for people (biodiversity, soil conservation, nutrient storage, carbon storage)\\
Manage the countryside (preserve habitats and landscape beauty) \\
Improve quality of life in farming areas\\
Ensure animal welfare\\

\subsubsection{The Union of Concerned Scientists idea}
"Sustainable agriculture does not mean a return to either the low yields or poor farmers that characterized the 19th century. Rather, sustainability builds on current agricultural achievements, adopting a sophisticated approach that can maintain high yields and farm profits without undermining the resources on which agriculture depends." 
"Sustainable Agriculture - A New Vision"; Union of Concerned Scientists, 1999
