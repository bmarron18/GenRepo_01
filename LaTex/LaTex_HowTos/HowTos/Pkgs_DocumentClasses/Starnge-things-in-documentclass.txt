	==== Using \documentclass{} ============

	# latex will read a .cls file in the same folder as the .tex file! No need to put the .cls file elsewhere
	# processing a .tex file using DVI means all figs seen as .eps files. Run with pdflatex only!
	
	# Cambridge University poster .cls requires .eps files -- cannot use .pdfs!
	# if try to use a .pdf with DVI latex does not recognize the pdf (thinks it's a .eps file; see log output)
error message: Cannot determine size of graphic in psulogo_horiz_msword.pdf (no BoundingBox)

	# cannot overide this even if provide bounding box data:
