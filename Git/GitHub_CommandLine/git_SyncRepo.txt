keep FORKED repo current with ORIGINAL_REPO
#############################################

After a Pull request has been accepted from a forked repo, GitHub will report,
"This branch is 1 commit behind LANDIS-II-Foundation:master"

Requires sync.
 


	a. create a Desktop folder, <name of repo>; clone a fresh LOCAL repo from the FORKED repo and specify a LOCAL remote named, 
	   'upstream' that links to the ORIGINAL_OWNER/ORIGINAL_REPO
	a1. should have two LOCAL repo connectionss, 'origin' and 'upstream' with fetch and push capabilities
	a2. Extension-Base-Harvest used as example

	b.  fetch changes from ORIGINAL_REPO to LOCAL repo ==> merge changes from ORIGINAL repo to LOCAL repo ==> push changes to FORKED repo
	b1. The push to the forked repo is what keeps the forked repo in sync



git clone https://github.com/bmarron18/Extension-Base-Harvest.git
git remote add upstream https://github.com/LANDIS-II-Foundation/Extension-Base-Harvest.git
git remote -v


git fetch upstream && 
git merge upstream/master && 
git push origin master
