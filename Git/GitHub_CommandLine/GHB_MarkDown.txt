Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. 
Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, 
then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).

The Markdown parser included in the Jupyter Notebook is MathJax-aware.
This means that you can freely mix in mathematical expressions using the MathJax subset of Tex and LaTeX. 
Some examples from the MathJax site are reproduced below, as well as the Markdown+TeX source.
